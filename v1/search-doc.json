When the side content is triggered, it replaces the main content. We recommend that you always place the trigger for the side content in the same location, such as in the app footer.  A special case allows switching the comparison mode between the main and side content. In this case, the screen is split into 50:50 percent for main vs. side content. The responsive behavior of the equal split is the same as in the standard view - the side content disappears on screen widths of less than 720 px and can only be viewed by triggering it.

Example:  First, copy the CSS files for all relevant packages to a directory that can be served, in this example, public/css/:  cp -r node_modules/@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/css/ public/css/base/ cp -r node_modules/@ui5/webcomponents-theming/dist/css/ public/css/theming/ cp -r node_modules/@ui5/webcomponents/dist/css/ public/css/main/ cp -r node_modules/@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/css/ public/css/fiori/   Note: make these commands part of your build task, if your app needs to be CSP-compliant on all browsers.  You will always need the CSS resources of the framework-level packages (@ui5/webcomponents-base and @ui5/webcomponents-theming), and additionally the ones of all components packages your app is going to use (such as @ui5/webcomponents and @ui5/webcomponents-fiori).  By convention, the CSS files are found in the dist/css/ directory for each package that ships CSS resources.  Call the 2 functions, described above, as follows:  import { setPackageCSSRoot, setUseLinks } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CSP.js&quot;; setUseLinks(!document.adoptedStyleSheets); // or &quot;true&quot;, to force all browsers to use links setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base&quot;, &quot;public/css/base/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-theming&quot;, &quot;public/css/theming/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents&quot;, &quot;public/css/main/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori&quot;, &quot;public/css/fiori/&quot;);   Calling setUseLinks with !document.adoptedStyleSheets as its argument is an easy way to tell the framework to use &lt;link&gt; tags only for the browsers that don't support Constructable Stylesheets. However, you can call setUseLinks(true) to make all browsers consume CSS from &lt;link&gt;s, if you prefer so.  Then, for each package, call setPackageCSSRoot and pass the directory, from which the CSS files will be served. You can pass relative paths to your HTML page, as in the example above, or fully qualified paths, for example:  setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base&quot;, &quot;https://my.site/path/to/public/css/base/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-theming&quot;, &quot;https://my.site/path/to/public/css/theming/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents&quot;, &quot;https://my.site/path/to/public/css/main/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori&quot;, &quot;https://my.site/path/to/public/css/fiori/&quot;);   It's simpler to just use relative paths, if your app is going to have one index.html file, and you can conveniently point to a directory, relative to it. However, in case components will be used in different pages across your site, or you are using URL re-writing, it would be safest to use fully qualified paths.

And, it is slotted in the content of the ui5-card.  When a web component of ours is about to be defined and registered in the global CustomElements registry, the framework checks if some of the slotted children are custom elements by checking the presence of a hyphen (&quot;-&quot;) in their tag names. And, if this is true, the framework waits for the children to be defined and registered first, because the state or visual appearance of the parent may rely on the slotted elements/children.  While this is required in many cases, for custom HTML elements with pure semantic purpose and no JavaScript class attached (f.e. app-trip-calendar) - it's not. Moreover, it leads to increasing the time to render parameter of the given web component (f.e.ui5-card).

In HTML you can define an element using a role. When you use semantic elements, you don’t need to define a role as these elements receive all relevant aria mappings out of the box. However, this is not the case when you use custom elements where you should add all relevant accessibility attributes yourselves.  This is not needed in UI5 Web Components, because when using our elements, all relevant accessibility attributes for a certain component will be applied in the shadow DOM, without further setup. Additionally, many accessibility-related APIs are available. They can be used to enhance the accessibility in the context of each application.  As the Web Components are a new standard, there are still some gaps in regard to accessibility. For example - setting IDRef relationships is currently not possible due to the nature of the custom elements and their shadow DOM. This is a limitation in the ARIA support and there is a draft of a new AOM (Accessibility Object Model), which addresses this issue and many more, and aims at a better JS-based accessibility support for all web elements. We are continuously working on improving the existing limitations. For example, in order to create a Label-Input relationship, you can use the for property of the label component to bind the label to an input, or accessible-name-ref property of the input component to bind the input to a label.

Navigation with the keyboard and screen reader should work properly together. In order for this to happen, you need to use the correct ARIA attributes and to map them to their HTML counterparts. With UI5 Web Components you will receive ARIA mapped elements out of the box. For example let's add a ui5-combobox component:  &lt;ui5-combobox&gt; &lt;ui5-cb-item text=&quot;Item 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-cb-item&gt; &lt;/ui5-combobox&gt;   By doing so, you receive an input element with role=&quot;combobox&quot; with all aria attributes relevant for this role in the shadow DOM. Also, if you set the disabled property, this will automatically add disabled to the shadow combobox element. Attribute mapping is available for all relevant properties - required, disabled, readonly, and more.

It marks the dynamic content changes as ARIA live regions so that you are able to inform the users of assistive technologies for a change that has happened to the UI.  The Invisible Messaging service is designed to be used both internally in the components logic and from the applications. Using the service, you have to specify the message to be announced by the screen reader and the mode which will be inserted in the aria-live attribute via the InvisibleMessage.announce(message, mode) method. The possible modes to choose from are:   InvisibleMessageMode.Assertive - indicates that updates to the region have the highest priority and should be presented to the user immediately.InvisibleMessageMode.Polite - indicates that updates to the region should be presented at the next graceful opportunity such as at the end of reading the current sentence, or when the user paused typing.  According to the WAI-ARIA recommendations, the live regions should be initialised empty when the page is loaded. This way screen readers remember them and start to listen for changes of their value. Thus, we recommend to instantiate Invisible Message as early as possible in the application.

Let's see the necessary files for a my-first-component component.  Class and template files​  The main files describing a Web Component are:  File\tPurposesrc/MyFirstComponent.js\tWeb Component class src/MyFirstComponent.hbs\tHandlebars template  In order to understand how a UI5 Web Component works and what lies behind these two files, make sure you check theDeveloping Web Components section of the documentation.  For the purposes of this tutorial, however, you don't need to understand their internals, as they are automatically generated by the script and are in a working state already.  Theming-related files​  A single set of CSS rules will be used for all themes. The only difference between themes may be the values of CSS Variables. Some CSS Vars, such as --sapBackgroundColor and --sapTextColor are standard and automatically managed by the framework. In addition, you can define your own CSS Vars and provide different values for them for the different themes. Set these CSS Vars in theparameters-bundle.css file for each theme. These files are the entry points for the styles build script.  File\tPurposesrc/themes/MyFirstComponent.css\tAll CSS rules for the Web Component, same for all themes; will be inserted in the shadow root. src/themes/sap_horizon/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_horizon theme src/themes/sap_horizon_dark/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_horizon_dark theme src/themes/sap_horizon_hcb/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_horizon_hcb theme src/themes/sap_horizon_hcw/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_horizon_hcw theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3 theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3_dark/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_dark theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3_hcb/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_hcb theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3_hcw/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_hcw theme  Note: It's up to you whether to put the CSS Vars directly in the parameters-bundle.css files for the different themes or to import them from separate .css files. You could have, for example, a MyFirstComponent-params.css file for each theme and import it into the parameters-bundle.css file: @import &quot;MyFirstComponent-params.css&quot;;.

It rather targets the use case of components that slot abstract items (UI5Element instances without a template) and require to be invalidated in turn whenever these items are invalidated.  The invalidateOnChildChange setting can be either a Boolean (true meaning invalidate the component on any change of a child in this slot) or an Object with properties and slots fields. They in turn can be either of type Boolean (true meaning invalidate on any property change or any slot change) or Array of strings indicating exactly which properties or slots lead to invalidation.  Examples:  In the following example, since invalidateOnChildChange is not used (false by default), the component will be invalidated whenever children are added/removed in the tabs slot, but not whenever a child in that slot changes.  { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;HTMLElement&quot;, &quot;propertyName&quot;: &quot;tabs&quot;, } } }   Setting invalidateOnChildChange to true means: invalidate the component whenever a child in the tabs slot gets invalidated, regardless of the reason.  { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;HTMLElement&quot;, &quot;propertyName&quot;: &quot;tabs&quot;, &quot;invalidateOnChildChange&quot;: true } } }   The example below results in exactly the same behavior as the one above, but it uses the more explicit Object format:  { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;HTMLElement&quot;, &quot;propertyName&quot;: &quot;tabs&quot;, &quot;invalidateOnChildChange&quot;: { &quot;properties&quot;: true, &quot;slots&quot;: true } } } }   The following example uses the Object format again and means: invalidate the component whenever the children in this slot are invalidated due to property changes, but not due to slot changes. Here &quot;slots&quot;: false is added for completeness (as false is the default value for both properties and slots)  { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;HTMLElement&quot;, &quot;propertyName&quot;: &quot;tabs&quot;, &quot;invalidateOnChildChange&quot;: { &quot;properties&quot;: true, &quot;slots&quot;: false } } } }   The final example shows the most complex format of invalidateOnChildChange which allows to define which slots or properties in the children inside that slot lead to invalidation of the component:  { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;HTMLElement&quot;, &quot;propertyName&quot;: &quot;tabs&quot;, &quot;invalidateOnChildChange&quot;: { &quot;properties&quot;: [&quot;text&quot;, &quot;selected&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot;], &quot;slots&quot;: [&quot;default&quot;] } } } }   Notes:  Children without a slot attribute will be assigned to the default slot.All HTML text nodes will be assigned to the default slot, as they cannot have a slot attribute.For all slots the Web Component will have a property created, with the name of the slot, to hold a list of all children assigned to this slot. For example, if you have a slot named &quot;rows&quot;, &quot;this.rows&quot; will be an array, holding references to all children with slot=&quot;rows&quot;, or no slot, if rows was default.For the default slot you can provide a propertyName setting.

A: Use this Playground. Q: Where is the documentation? A: There are several resources: Web Components APIsFirst stepsHow to get started? Q: Is there a CDN to load UI5 Web Components from? A: No. The best practice is to build your own bundle. See this article for details. Q: Are UI5 Web Components APIs stable? A: Mostly yes since the project is in Release Candidate state, but minor changes may still be expected until the official release. Q: Can I create my own UI5 Web Components? A: Yes, for more information see Creating a Custom UI5 Web Components Package Q: How can I customize UI5 Web Components' styles? A: Read the Styling UI5 Web Components article. Q: How big is the runtime? A: Currently on main, a simple working Web Component (ui5-label) and its dependencies equals to around 22K gzipped. Two simple web components (ui5-label and ui5-icon) and their dependencies equal to around 25K gzipped. Note: The quoted numbers include only a &lt;ui5-label&gt; (respectively ui5-label and ui5-icon) working on Chrome/FF/Safari with the default settings (theme/language). Additional features, settings and old browser support will increase bundle size accordingly. Q: What is the difference between UI5 Web Components and OpenUI5? A: See the project's readme.md for more on this. Q: Can I use UI5 Web Components in an OpenUI5 application? A: This is not necessary as OpenUI5 already provides equivalents in the form of UI5 Controls. Q: How can I hide not yet upgraded Web Components so that users don't see them until styled? A: You can place a CSS rule such as: *:not(:defined) { display: none; } or: *:not(:defined) { visibility: hidden; } in your application, depending on your preference. The selector *:not(:defined) will match all web components that haven't been defined yet. Alternatively, you could only apply this rule for selected web components: ui5-button:not(:defined), ui5-label:not(:defined) { display: none; } Please note that the :defined CSS pseudo-selector is not supported by the Edge and Internet Explorer 11 browsers.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Usage with Frameworks","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/webcomponents/v1/docs/frameworks/","content":"Usage with Frameworks In this section, you can find framework-specific tutorials on how to get started with UI5 Web Components.

Rename &quot;event&quot; to &quot;e&quot; in the .ts files as it collides with the @event decorator.  Since the event decorator is being imported with the event keyword  Example:  import event from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/event.js&quot;;   Using the keyword &quot;event&quot; as a parameter for our handlers leads to a collision between the parameter and the @event decorator.    // Before ( which would lead to a name collision now ) _onfocusin(event: FocusEvent) { const target = event.target as ProductSwitchItem; this._itemNavigation.setCurrentItem(target); this._currentIndex = this.items.indexOf(target); }   To avoid this and keep consistency, we decided to name the parameters in our handlers &quot;e&quot; instead.  // After _onfocusin(e: FocusEvent) { const target = e.target as ProductSwitchItem; this._itemNavigation.setCurrentItem(target); this._currentIndex = this.items.indexOf(target); }     2. Initialize all class members directly in the constructor.  When creating classes, initialize all class members directly in the constructor, and not in another method, called in the constructor. This is to ensure that TypeScript understands that a class member will be always initialized, therefore is not optional.   Example:  // Before class UI5Element extends HTMLElement { constructor() { super(); this._initializeState(); } _initializeState() { const ctor = this.constructor; this._state = { ...ctor.getMetadata().getInitialState() }; } }   Before the change, we used to initialize _state in the _initializeState function. However, after the refactoring to TypeScript, we must do it directly in the constructor, otherwise it is not recognized as always initialized.  // After class UI5Element extends HTMLElement { _state: State, constructor() { super(); const ctor = this.constructor as typeof UI5Element; this._state = { ...ctor.getMetadata().getInitialState() }; } }     3. Create types for the Event Details.  To enhance the quality and readability of our code, we should establish specific types for the Event Details. This approach will clearly define the required data for an event and optimize its usage. Without well-defined EventDetail types, we may also encounter naming conflicts between similar event names in various components, leading to potential errors. Implementing EventDetail types will effectively resolve this issue.  3.1 How should we structure the name of our EventDetail type ? To be consistent within our project, the latest convention about how we name our EventDetail types is by using the following pattern:   // File: DayPicker.ts // The pattern is // &lt;&lt;WebComponentName&gt;&lt;EventName&gt;&lt;EventDetail&gt;&gt; type DayPickerChangeEventDetail = { dates: Array&lt;number&gt;, timestamp?: number, } class DayPicker extends CalendarPart implements ICalendarPicker { ... _selectDate(e: Event, isShift: boolean) { ... this.fireEvent&lt;DayPickerChangeEventDetail&gt;(&quot;change&quot;, { timestamp: this.timestamp, dates: this.selectedDates, }); } }     4. Use the syntax of Array&lt;T&gt; instead of T[].  While both notations work the same way, we have chosen to utilize the Array&lt;T&gt; notation, as opposed to T[], to maintain consistency with the notations for Map&lt;&gt; and Record&lt;&gt;.  For example:  // Instead of let openedRegistry: RegisteredPopUpT[] = []; // We’ll use let openedRegistry: Array&lt;RegisteredPopupT&gt; = [];     5. Use enums over object literals.  Instead of using object literals, we have opted for enums to enhance type safety and maintainability. The use of enums provides compile-time type safety, reducing the potential for errors and making the code easier to manage. It is also important to note that all types in our &quot;types&quot; folder are already represented as enums.  Example:  // File: ColorConvension.ts // Instead of const CSSColors = { aliceblue: &quot;f0f8ff&quot;, antiquewhite: &quot;faebd7&quot;, aqua: &quot;00ffff&quot;, aquamarine: &quot;7fffd4&quot;, } // We’ll use enum CSSColors { aliceblue = &quot;f0f8ff&quot;, antiquewhite = &quot;faebd7&quot;, aqua = &quot;00ffff&quot;, aquamarine = &quot;7fffd4&quot;, }     6. Use the &quot;keyof typeof&quot; syntax when dynamically accessing objects with known keys.  When dynamically accessing objects with known keys, always use the &quot;keyof typeof&quot; syntax for improved accuracy.  Example:  // File: ColorConvension.ts enum CSSColors { aliceblue = &quot;f0f8ff&quot;, antiquewhite = &quot;faebd7&quot;, aqua = &quot;00ffff&quot;, aquamarine = &quot;7fffd4&quot;, } … const getRGBColor = (color: string): ColorRGB =&gt; { ... if (color in CSSColors) { color = CSSColors[color as keyof typeof CSSColors]; } return HEXToRGB(color); };     In the cases where the keys are unknown or uncertain, we use the Record&lt;K, T&gt; notation instead of the {[key]} notation. In short, Record&lt;K, T&gt; is a TypeScript notation for describing an object with keys of type K and values of type T.  Example:  // File: UI5ElementMetadata.ts ... type Metadata = { tag: string, managedSlots?: boolean, properties?: Record&lt;string, Property&gt;, slots?: Record&lt;string, Slot&gt;, events?: Array&lt;object&gt;, fastNavigation?: boolean, themeAware?: boolean, languageAware?: boolean, };     7. Do not use &quot;any&quot;, unless absolutely necessary.  The &quot;any&quot; type instructs the TypeScript compiler to ignore type checking for a specific variable or expression. This can result in errors and make the code more complex to understand and maintain. Our ESLint usually takes care of this by enforcing best practices and avoiding its usage.

When to use &quot;import type&quot; ?  The import keyword is used to import values from a module, while import type is used to import only the type information of a module without its values. This type of information can be used in type annotations and declarations.    For clarity, it is recommended to keep type and non-type imports on separate lines and explicitly mark types with the type keyword, as in the following example:  // This line import I18nBundle, { getI18nBundle, I18nText } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/i18nBundle.js&quot;;    // Should be split into // Named export (function) called into the component class import { getI18nBundle } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/i18nBundle.js&quot;; // Default type export. // Although I18nBundle is a class, it's used as a type of a variable. import type I18nBundle from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/i18nBundle.js&quot;; // Named type export, used as a type of a variable. import type { I18nText } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/i18nBundle.js&quot;;     2. When should we use the &quot;!&quot; operator in component's file ?  The ! operator in TypeScript is used to indicate that a value is not null or undefined in situations where the type checker cannot determine it.  It is commonly used when working with the this.getDomRef() and this.shadowRoot properties in our web components. The return types of these properties, HTMLElement | null and ShadowRoot | null, respectively, are marked with null because there may be instances when these values are not yet available.  This operator can also be used in other situations where TypeScript does not understand the framework's lifecycle, for example, when working with custom elements.  In short, the ! operator is a useful tool for ensuring that a value is not null or undefined in cases where the type checker cannot determine this on its own.  For example:  import UI5Element from &quot;sap/ui/core/Element&quot;; class Example extends UI5Element { testProperty?: string; onBeforeRendering() { this.testProperty = &quot;Some text&quot;; } onAfterRendering() { // here TypeScript will complain that the testProperty may be undefined // in order of its definition and because it doesn't understand the framework's lifecycle const varName: string = this.testProperty!; } }     3. Usage of Generics.  Generics in TypeScript help us with the creation of classes, functions, and other entities that can work with multiple types, instead of just a single one. This allows users to use their own types when consuming these entities.  Generic functions have been added to the UI5Element, and a common approach for using built-in generics has been established. Our first generic function is the fireEvent function, which uses generics to describe the event details and to check that all necessary details have been provided. The types used to describe the details provide helpful information to consumers of the event as explained above.  For example:  fireEvent&lt;EventDetail&gt;(&quot;click&quot;)     The use of custom events as the type for the first argument of an event handler can result in TypeScript complaining about unknown properties in the details. By using generics and introducing a type for event details, we can tell TypeScript which parameters are included in the details, and thus avoid these complaints.  handleClick(e: CustomEvent&lt;EventDetail&gt;)   The second use of generics is in the querySelector function. It allows us to specify a custom element return type, such as &quot;List,&quot; while retaining the default return type of T | null. This allows for more precise type checking and a better understanding of the expected return value.  It's important to note that casting the returned result will exclude &quot;null.&quot; Additionally, if the result is always in the template and not surrounded by expressions, the &quot;!&quot; operator can be used.  async _getDialog() { const staticAreaItem = await this.getStaticAreaItemDomRef(); return staticAreaItem!.querySelector&lt;Dialog&gt;(&quot;[ui5-dialog]&quot;)!; }   The third use case for generics is with the getFeature function. This function enables us to retrieve a feature if it is registered. It is important to note that getFeature returns the class definition, rather than an instance of the class. To use it effectively, the typeof keyword should be utilized to obtain the class type, which will then be set as the return type of the function.  \tgetFeature&lt;typeof FormSupportT&gt;(&quot;FormSupport&quot;)     4. Managing Component Styles with CSSMap and ComponentStylesData in the Inheritance Chain  To resolve inheritance chain issues, we introduced two types that can be used in the components. All components have implemented a static get styles function that returns either an array with required styles or just the component styles without an array. However, depending on the inheritance chain, TypeScript may complain about wrong return types, without considering that they will be merged into a flat array in the end.  // File: ListItem.ts static get styles(): ComponentStylesData { return [ListItemBase.styles, styles]; }     5. Resolving the this type error with TypeScript.  By default in Strict Mode, the type of this is explicitly any. When used in a global context function, as in the example, TypeScript will raise an error that this has an explicit type of any. To resolve this, you can add this as the first argument to the function and provide its type, usually the context in which the function will be used.  type MyType = { base: number; pow: (exponent: number) =&gt; number; }; function pow(this: MyType, exponent: number) { return Math.pow(this.base, exponent); } const basePow: MyType = { base: 2, pow, };  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Deep dive and best practices","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/webcomponents/v1/docs/development/deep-dive-and-best-practices/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Table of contents​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deep dive and best practices","url":"/webcomponents/v1/docs/development/deep-dive-and-best-practices/#table-of-contents","content":" Metadata deep dive TagPropertiesSlotsEventsWrapping up metadata Understanding rendering What is rendering?Physical and logical componentsWhat is invalidation?

See Scoping for more on using a suffix with tag names.  Important: the pure tag name of every UI5 Web Component is always set as an attribute to the component too.  For example, when you create a ui5-button:  &lt;ui5-button id=&quot;b1&quot; class=&quot;button1&quot; design=&quot;Emphasized&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-button&gt;   the framework will create an empty attribute with the name ui5-button too, so the actual DOM would look like this:  &lt;ui5-button id=&quot;b1&quot; class=&quot;button1&quot; design=&quot;Emphasized&quot; ui5-button&gt;&lt;/ui5-button&gt;   Even if a suffix for tag names is configured (as described in Scoping), the attribute with the pure tag name will be the same.  For example, if the configured suffix is -demo and all components are used with this suffix:  &lt;ui5-button-demo id=&quot;b1&quot; class=&quot;button1&quot; design=&quot;Emphasized&quot; ui5-button&gt;&lt;/ui5-button-demo&gt;   the attribute will still be the same (ui5-button as opposed to the tag name of ui5-button-demo).  Therefore, the best practice when developing UI5 Web Components is to write CSS selectors for the shadow roots using attribute selectors, instead of tag selectors.  For example, if the Demo.hbs file looks like this:  &lt;div class=&quot;my-component&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-button id=&quot;openBtn&quot;&gt;Open&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ui5-list&gt;&lt;/ui5-list&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   you should not write selectors by tag name for other components in the Demo.css file:  ui5-button { width: 50px; }   because, as stated above, the tag name could be suffixed and is not guaranteed to always be the same as the pure tag name.  Instead, use the attribute selector:  [ui5-button] { width: 50px; }   or another type of selector (for example by ID):  #openBtn { width: 50px; }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Properties ​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deep dive and best practices","url":"/webcomponents/v1/docs/development/deep-dive-and-best-practices/#properties-","content":" Properties are managed state​  The framework will create a getter/setter pair on your component's prototype for each property, defined in the metadata.  For example, after setting this metadata configuration:  metadata: { properties: { text: { type: String } } }   you can use the text getter/setter on this component's instances:  let t = myComponent.text; myComponent.text = &quot;New text&quot;;   Whenever text is read or set, the framework-defined getter/setter will be called and thus the framework will be in control of the property.  Properties vs attributes​  The properties section defines both properties and attributes for your component. By default, for each property (camelCase name) an attribute with the same name but in kebab-case is supported. Properties of type Object have no attribute counterparts. If you wish to not have an attribute for a given property regardless of type, you can configure it with noAttribute: true.  Public vs private properties​  The framework does not distinguish between public and private properties. You can treat some properties as private in a sense that you can document them as such and not advertise them to users. The usual convention is that private properties start with an _, but this is not mandatory. In the end, all properties defined in the metadata, public or private, are component state, therefore cause the component to be invalidated and subsequently re-rendered, when changed.  Property types and default values​  The most common types of properties are String, Boolean, Object, Integer and Float. The last two are custom types, provided by the framework, that you must import (they do not exist in the browser).  Most property types can have a defaultValue set. Boolean is always false by default and Object is always {} by default, so defaultValue is not allowed for these types.  You can also create custom property types by extending @ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/DataType.js and implementing its methods for your type.  Properties with multiple: true​  If you configure a property with multiple: true, it will be an array of elements of the given type, and will be treated by the framework exactly as a property of type Object would be (as arrays are technically objects). For example, it will not have an attribute counterpart.  Example:  metadata: { properties: { numbers: { type: Integer, multiple: true } } }   myComponent.numbers = [1, 2, 3];   Properties with multiple: true are rarely used in practice, as they are not DOM-friendly (cannot be set in a declarative way, only with Javascript). Their most common use case is as private properties for communication between related components. For example, the higher-order &quot;date picker&quot; component communicates with its &quot;day picker&quot;, &quot;month picker&quot;, and &quot;year picker&quot; parts by means of private multiple properties (to pass arrays of selected dates).  If you need to use a property with multiple: true as part of your component's public API, that is fine, but bear in mind the limitations (no declarative support as with all Objects, so no attribute for this property).  The alternative would be to use abstract items, for example:  &lt;my-component&gt; &lt;my-item slot=&quot;numbers&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/my-item&gt; &lt;my-item slot=&quot;numbers&quot; value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/my-item&gt; &lt;my-item slot=&quot;numbers&quot; value=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/my-item&gt; &lt;/my-component&gt;   Here instead of having a numbers property of type Integer, configured with multiple: true, we have a numbers slot, and inside this slot we pass abstract items with a value property of type Integer. This is now completely declarative, and is preferable unless the number of items is very large (in which case the solution with the multiple property would likely be better).  Examples​  Example of defining properties:  import Integer from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/types/Integer.js&quot;; import Float from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/types/Float.js&quot;; ... metadata: { tag: &quot;my-component&quot;, properties: { text: { type: String, defaultValue: &quot;Hello&quot; }, width: { type: Integer, defaultValue: 1024, noAttribute: true }, scale: { type: Float, defaultValue: 0.5 } data: { type: Object }, /** * @private */ _isPhone: { type: Boolean } } }   Here text, width, scale and data are public properties, and _isPhone private, but only by convention. If the user (or the component internally) changes any of these properties, the component will be invalidated.  Best practices for using properties​  The best practice is to never change public properties from within the component (they are owned by the application) unless the property changes due to user interaction (f.e. the user typed in an input - so you change the value property; or the user clicked a checkbox - and you flip the checked property). It is also a best practice to always fire an event if you change a public property due to user interaction, to let the application know and synchronize its own state.  As for private properties, the best practice is to only change them internally and never let the application know about their existence.  Both public and private properties are great ways to create CSS selectors for your component with the :host() selector. The :host() selector targets the custom element itself, and can be combined with other selectors:  :host { height: 5rem; width: 5rem; } :host([size=&quot;XS&quot;]) { height: 2rem; width: 2rem; }   &lt;my-comopnent size=&quot;XS&quot;&gt;&lt;/my-comopnent&gt; &lt;!-- :host() targets my-component --&gt;   Here for example, if the size property (respectively the attribute with the same name) is set to XS, the component's dimensions will be changed from 5rem to 2rem. Using attribute selectors is the best practice as you don't have to set CSS classes on your component - you can write CSS selectors with :host() by attribute.  Metadata properties vs normal JS properties​  It is important not to confuse metadata-defined properties with regular Javascript properties. You can create any number of properties on your component's instance, f.e.:  constructor() { super(); this._isMobile = false; }   However, only metadata-defined properties are managed by the framework: cause invalidation and are converted to/from attributes. Feel free to create as many regular JS properties for the purpose of your component's functionality as you need, but bear in mind that they will not be managed by the framework.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Slots ​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deep dive and best practices","url":"/webcomponents/v1/docs/development/deep-dive-and-best-practices/#slots-","content":" While properties define the objective characteristics of a component, slots define the way a component can nest other HTML elements. You don't need to define slots for every component - some components are not meant to hold any other HTML elements, and are fully operated by properties and events alone.  You implement slots by configuring them with the slots metadata object, and rendering respective &lt;slot&gt; elements in your .hbs template.  You can read more about the slot HTML Element here.  Default slot and named slots​  For named slots you set the name you wish to use for the slot as the key in the slots metadata object.  Example:  slots: { items: { type: HTMLElement }, footer: { type: HTMLElement } }   and then in your .hbs template you render respectively &lt;slot name=&quot;items&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt; and &lt;slot name=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;.  The default slot on the other hand must be defined with the default key in the slots metadata object (also note the quotes around the default key as it is a reserved word):  slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { type: Node, } }   and then in the .hbs template you render &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;.  Slot types​  Unlike properties, slots can be of only two types: HTMLElement and Node.  HTMLElement means the slot accepts only other HTML Elements. You can use this type for any slot (default or named).  Node means that the slot can accept both HTML Elements and Text nodes, and is allowed only for the default slot. The reason for this restriction is that text nodes in HTML cannot have attributes, hence they cannot be slotted as HTML Elements can. As a result, text can only go the default slot, hence Node is applicable only for default slots.  Are slots managed state?​  Unlike metadata properties, which are always managed state (see the previous section), slots are not managed by the framework by default. Changes to slots do not trigger lifecycle events such as invalidation.  However, you can change this by setting managedSlots: true in the metadata object. This setting is global and affects all slots for your component.  managedSlots: true, slots:\t{ items: { type: HTMLElement }, footer: { type: HTMLElement } }   Now, if children are added/removed/rearranged in any of the above slots, the component will be invalidated.  Slot accessors​  Additionally, when you set managedSlots: true, you get a read-only accessor for the children in that slot.  Taking the example from above:  managedSlots: true, slots:\t{ items: { type: HTMLElement }, footer: { type: HTMLElement } }   you will get the following accessors on your component's instances:  const childrenInItems = this.items; // array of all children in the items slot const childrenInFooter = this.footer; // array of all children in the footer slot   Finally, it's possible to define the property name for the accessor of the default slot (as using the default key is not convenient in Javascript). You can do this with the propertyName setting:  managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { type: Node, propertyName: &quot;content&quot; }, items: { type: HTMLElement }, footer: { type: HTMLElement } }   const childrenInDefaultSlot = this.content; // array of all children in the default slot const childrenInItems = this.items; // array of all children in the items slot const childrenInFooter = this.footer; // array of all children in the footer slot   These getters are helpful if your code needs to analyze/communicate with the children in a certain slot. They are also often used in the .hbstemplate where you need for example to loop over the items of a component.  Individual slots​  All children, assigned to a certain slot, are rendered by the browser next to each other in the exact order in which they were passed to the component. Sometimes, however, each child must be placed separately in the shadow root, potentially wrapped in other HTML elements, to satisfy the UX design of the component.  The individualSlots slot metadata configuration setting (see Understanding UI5 Web Components Metadata) allows you to have a separate physical slot for each child belonging to a certain slot.  Example:  { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { type: HTMLElement, propertyName: &quot;items&quot;, individualSlots: true } } }   The framework will then create an _individualSlot property on each child, belonging to the slot. Just render these slots in the .hbs template to have all children belonging to the slot displayed by the browser separately in your HTML markup of choice.  For more information on individual slots and how to render them in the .hbs template click here.  The invalidateOnChildChange setting​  There is one last configuration setting for slots - invalidateOnChildChange. When set to true, whenever a child in a certain slot is invalidated, your component will be invalidated as well.  managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { type: HTMLElement, propertyName: &quot;items&quot;, invalidateOnChildChange: true }, }   Now, the component will be invalidated not only when children are added/removed/rearranged, but also when children themselves change. This is very handy for components working with abstract items.  Read more about abstract items and invalidateOnChildChange in the Invalidation section later in this article.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Events ​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deep dive and best practices","url":"/webcomponents/v1/docs/development/deep-dive-and-best-practices/#events-","content":" Most components fire events to notify the application of user interaction.  You can list the events fired by your component in the events metadata object, but this is optional and mostly done for documentation purposes. Any event that you dispatch from your component will reach the application anyway.  Here is an example how to fire an event from your component:  Declare the event in your metadata (optional, but highly recommended for documentation purposes and clarity):  events: { toggle: {} }   In the .hbs template bind an event listener to some part of your component's HTML to be able to take action on user interaction:  &lt;div class=&quot;my-panel&quot;&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;my-panel-toggle&quot; @click=&quot;{{onPanelToggleClick}}&quot;&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;my-panel-body&quot;&gt; &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   In this example we have a simplified &quot;panel&quot; component consisting of a toggle button and a slot for the panel content. We bind the click event of the &lt;button&gt; we'll use for toggling our panel to the onPanelToggleClick method.  For more on the .hbs template syntax and event listeners click here.  Implement the event handler in your component:  class MyPanel extends UI5Element { ... onPanelToggleClick(event) { this.togglePanel(); // do some work when the user clicks the button this.fireEvent(&quot;toggle&quot;); // fire the event } }   The fireEvent method is provided by the base UI5Element.js class and is therefore available to all components. The best practice is to always use this method instead of simply calling the standard dispatchEvent function as fireEvent has framework-related enhanced functionality.  That's all it takes to manage an event's lifecycle! Now your component's users may listen for the toggle event:  const panel = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;my-panel&quot;)[0]; panel.addEventListener(&quot;toggle&quot;, () =&gt; {});   Working with event parameters​  The above example demonstrated an event with no parameters. However, you can send arbitrary data to the app when firing an event.  Here's how:  Declare the event in your metadata and describe its parameters (again, optional, but good for consistency and documentation purposes):  events: { selectionChange: { detail: { item: { type: HTMLElement }, oldItem: { type: HTMLElement } } } }   Here we define a selectionChange event which gives the app two pieces of information: item (the newly selected item) and oldItem (the previously selected item). Respectively they will be accessible by the app with event.detail.item and event.detail.oldItem in the event handler, exactly like it works with native browser events.  Pass the data when firing the event:  class MyItemsList extends UI5Element { ... onSelectionChange(event) { ... this.fireEvent(&quot;selectionChange&quot;, { item: item, oldItem: oldItem, }); } }   To pass parameters, simply provide a second parameter of type Object to fireEvent with keys for all event parameters.  The usage of the event by the app will be exactly like in the case of a native HTML element:  const list = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;my-items-list&quot;)[0]; list.addEventListener(&quot;selectionChange&quot;, (event) =&gt; { console.log(event.detail.item); console.log(event.detail.oldItem); });   Events and noConflict mode​  By default, when using the fireEvent method, as demonstrated above, actually not just one, but two custom events are fired: one with the name, provided as the first argument to fireEvent, and one more with the same name, but prefixed by ui5-.  For example, the following code:  fireEvent(&quot;toggle&quot;);   will dispatch two custom events by default:  toggleui5-toggle  However, if you set the noConflict configuration setting to true, only the prefixed event will be dispatched.  So, when noConflict: true is configured, the same code:  fireEvent(&quot;toggle&quot;);   would result in just:  ui5-toggle  Therefore, the best practice when binding to events, fired by other UI5 Web Components in your .hbs template, is to always use the prefixed (ui5-) event.  Example:  &lt;div class=&quot;my-component&quot;&gt; &lt;button @click=&quot;{{onNativeButtonClick}}&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt; &lt;ui5-button @ui5-click=&quot;{{onUI5ButtonClick}}&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;input @change=&quot;{{onNativeInputChange}}&quot; /&gt; &lt;ui5-input @ui5-change=&quot;{{onUI5InputChange}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-input&gt; &lt;ui5-list @ui5-item-click=&quot;{{onUI5ListItemClick}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-list&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   Please note the following:  For native HTML elements (input, button) we bind to their respective events (change, click) normally.For other UI5 Web Components (ui5-button, ui5-input, ui5-list), rendered by our component, we bind to the ui5- events as these are guaranteed to be dispatched even when noConflict is configured to true.  If we used the non-prefixed versions:  &lt;div class=&quot;my-component&quot;&gt; &lt;button @click=&quot;{{onNativeButtonClick}}&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt; &lt;ui5-button @click=&quot;{{onUI5ButtonClick}}&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;input @change=&quot;{{onNativeInputChange}}&quot; /&gt; &lt;ui5-input @change=&quot;{{onUI5InputChange}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-input&gt; &lt;ui5-list @item-click=&quot;{{onUI5ListItemClick}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-list&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   this would work well only with the default configuration (where noConflict is false and both events are fired), but our code would &quot;break&quot; the moment an app sets noConflict: true since that would suppress UI5 Web Components from firing the non-prefixed versions and our event handlers (onUI5ButtonClick, onUI5InputChange, etc.) would never be executed.

For example, consider a component with the following metadata:  { tag: &quot;my-demo-component&quot;, properties: { text: { type: String, defaultValue: &quot;Hello&quot; }, selected: { type: Boolean, noAttribute: true } }, managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { type: Node, propertyName: &quot;items&quot;, invalidateOnChildChange: true }, &quot;icon&quot;: { type: HTMLElement } }, events: { change: { detail: { newText: {type: String} } } } }   This metadata conveys the following:  This component will have the following getters/setters, created for it by the framework:  this.text (getter/setter, due to the text property) with default value of &quot;Hello&quot;this.selected (getter/setter, due to the selected property) with default value of false (all Booleans are false by default in HTML and defaultValue cannot be configured for them)this.items (getter only, due to having managedSlots: true and the propertyName of the default slot being items) - an array of all Text Nodes and HTML Elements in the default slotthis.icon (getter only, due to having managedSlots: true and the icon slot) - an array of all HTML Elements in the icon slot  The component will have only 1 attribute:  text due to the text property (the other property has noAttribute: true set)  When the text property changes, the text attribute will also be reflected and vice-versa.  The component fires 1 event:  change with one string parameter: newText  This component will be invalidated whenever any of its properties changes, any of its slots has new/removed/rearranged children, and additionally when any UI5 Web Component in the default slot is invalidated.  In this component's .hbs you are expected to render the two slots and to bind an event listener for the event:  &lt;div class=&quot;my-demo-component&quot;&gt; &lt;header&gt; &lt;slot name=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt; &lt;input class=&quot;demo-input&quot; value=&quot;{{text}}&quot; @change=&quot;{{onInputChange}}&quot;&gt; &lt;/header&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   and in the component's class you are expected to fire the event, for example:  class MyDemoComponent extends HTMLElement { ... onInputChange(event) { const newText = this.shadowRoot.querySelector(&quot;.demo-input&quot;).value; this.text = newText; event.stopPropagation(); this.fireEvent(&quot;change&quot;, { newText }); } }   Whenever the user stops typing in the &lt;input&gt; and its change event is fired, our component's onInputChange event handler will be executed. There we get the new value of the input, update the text metadata property to reflect its new state, stop the input's native change event from propagating since we'll be firing our custom event with the same name (and we don't want the user to get 2 events with the same name), and finally we fire our metadata event (change) with the newText parameter.

If an already invalidated component gets changed again, before having been re-rendered, this will have no downside - it's in the queue of components to be re-rendered anyway.  Important: when a component is re-rendered, only the parts of its shadow DOM, dependent on the changed properties/slots are changed, which makes most updates very fast.  A component becomes invalidated whenever:  a metadata-defined property changes (not regular properties that f.e. you define in the constructor)children are added/removed/rearranged in any slot and the component has managedSlots: true set in the metadata objecta slotted child in a slot configured with invalidateOnChildChange: true is invalidated.  Changes to properties always cause an invalidation. No specific metadata configuration is needed.  properties: { text: { type: String } }   Whenever text changes, the component will be invalidated.  Changes to slots do not cause an invalidation by default. Most components do not need to render differently based on whether they have any slotted children or not. The most common example for this are simple general-purpose containers (completely agnostic of their content).  metadata: { slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { type: HTMLElement }, header: { type: HTMLElement }, footer: { type: HTMLElement } } }   This component will not invalidate when children are added/removed from any of its slots.  However, some components render differently based on whether they have children or not (e.g. show counters/other UX elements for the number of children, f.e. carousel; or have special styles when empty or have a child in a specific slot, f.e. button with an icon). If that is the case for the component you're building, set managedSlots: true in your component's metadata. Thus, your component will become invalidated whenever children are added, removed or swap places in any of its slots.  managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { type: HTMLElement }, header: { type: HTMLElement }, footer: { type: HTMLElement } }   Now that this component has managedSlots: true, changes to each slot will trigger an invalidation. Note that the managedSlots configuration is global (and not per slot).  And finally, there are components that not only need to render differently based on the number/type of children they have, but they must also get invalidated whenever their children change. This holds true for all components that work with abstract items (such as select with options, combo box with combo box items) because these abstract items do not have a template (do not render themselves) and therefore rely on their parent to render some DOM for them in its own shadow root. So, when they get invalidated, they must also invalidate their parent.  managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { type: HTMLElement, invalidateOnChildChange: true }, header: { type: HTMLElement }, footer: { type: HTMLElement } }   Only changes to children in the &quot;default&quot; slot will trigger invalidation for this component. Note that invalidateOnChildChange is defined per slot (and not globally like managedSlots). Finally, invalidateOnChildChange allows for more fine-granular rules when exactly children can invalidate their parents - see Understanding UI5 Web Components Metadata.

Let's imagine we want to only show the items whose name property matches the value of our filter property - so we filter the items by name.  constructor() { super(); this._filteredItems = []; } onBeforeRendering() { this._filteredItems = this.items.filter(item =&gt; item.name.includes(this.filter)); }   In onBeforeRendering we prepare a _filteredItems array with some of the component's children (only the ones that have the this.filter text as part of their name property)  And finally, in the .hbs template we have for example:  &lt;div class=&quot;my-filter-component&quot;&gt; {{#each _filteredItems}} &lt;div class=&quot;my-filtered-item&quot;&gt; &lt;slot name=&quot;{{_individualSlot}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt; &lt;/div&gt; {{/each}} &lt;/div&gt;   We loop over the _fiteredItems array that we prepared in onBeforeRendering and for each child we render a slot based on the child's _individualSlot property, created automatically by the framework due to the default slot's metadata configuration (individualSlots: true).  The usage of this component would be for example:  &lt;my-filter-component filter=&quot;John&quot;&gt; &lt;my-filter-item name=&quot;John Smith&quot;&gt;&lt;/my-filter-item&gt; &lt;my-filter-item name=&quot;Jane Doe&quot;&gt;&lt;/my-filter-item&gt; &lt;my-filter-item name=&quot;Jack Johnson&quot;&gt;&lt;/my-filter-item&gt; &lt;/my-filter-component&gt;   The user would only see the first and third items as these are the only ones we rendered an individual slot for (the ones matching the filter value of &quot;John&quot;).

Note that these hooks are completely independent of the component's rendering lifecycle, and are solely related to its insertion and removal from DOM.  Normally, when a web component is created, for example:  const b = document.createElement(&quot;ui5-button&quot;);   it is already fully operational, although it isn't in DOM yet. Therefore, you should use onEnterDOM and onExitDOM only for functionality, related to the component being in the DOM tree at all (and not to rendering, stying or anything related to the shadow root).  Common use cases are:  registering/de-registering a ResizeHandlerworking with Intersection observerany work you want to carry out only if the component is in the DOM;  Probably the best example of these hooks is the usage of the ResizeHandler helper class.  The component has a private _width property, defined in its metadata:  properties: { /** * @private */ _width: { type: Integer } }   and the following code in its class:  import ResizeHandler from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/delegate/ResizeHandler.js&quot;; import Integer from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/types/Integer.js&quot;; class MyComponent extends UI5Element { constructor() { super(); this._fnOnResize = this._onResize.bind(this); } onEnterDOM() { ResizeHandler.register(this, this._fnOnResize); } onExitDOM() { ResizeHandler.deregister(this, this._fnOnResize); } _onResize() { this._width = this.offsetWidth; } get styles() { return { valueStateMsgPopover: { &quot;max-width&quot;: `${this._width}px`, }, }; } }   In the constructor we bind the _onResize method to the component's instance to get a function with the correct context, and then in onEnterDOM and onExitDOM we register/deregister this function with the ResizeHandler helper class.  Then, whenever the component resizes, the ResizeHandler will trigger the callback, the metadata _width property will be updated to a new value in _onResize, the component will be invalidated, and the template will be executed with the new value of _width, respectively styles.

Normally, the whole HTML markup of a UI5 Web Component is found in one place - the shadow DOM of the custom element itself.  Example:  &lt;ui5-button id=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/ui5-button&gt;   All HTML, belonging to this ui5-button instance is in its own shadow DOM.

However, there are more complex components, whose HTML is split in two parts - the custom element's shadow DOM (as is the case with the button), but also a so called static area part, holding all popups this component might open. This is the case with most components that have any kind of popup-related functionality (dropdowns, rich tooltips, popovers, dialogs).

Since two of them have static area parts, the framework has created a ui5-static-area (one for the whole page) and inside it a ui5-static-area-itemfor each component with a static area part.  Thus, the HTML, defining the ui5-select and ui5-date-picker components is split in two parts of the HTML page:  the shadow DOM of the custom element itself (ui5-select, ui5-date-picker)the shadow DOM of the static-area-item, created for the respective component.  This is necessary because such a split is the only way to guarantee that a popup (dropdown, rich tooltip, popover, etc.) will always be positioned correctly on the HTML page, even if parts of the page have:  transform: translateoverflow: hiddenz-index  Since the ui5-statia-area is a top-level body child, it is guaranteed to be on top of everything else on the page with the correct CSS styles, regardless of the page structure and stacking context.  If we did not use a static area, for example as in a component, defined like this:  In the MySelect.js file:  &lt;div class=&quot;my-select&quot;&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Click to open the dropdown:&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;button @click=&quot;{{onOpenDropdownClick}}&quot;&gt;Dropdown&lt;/button&gt; &lt;ui5-popover id=&quot;#popover&quot; ?open=&quot;{{dropdownOpen}}&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-list&gt; {{#each dropdownItems}} &lt;ui5-li&gt;{{text}}&lt;/ui5-li&gt; {{/each}} &lt;/ui5-list&gt; &lt;/ui5-popover&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   In the MySelect.js file:  class MySelect extends UI5Element { ... onOpenDropdownClick(event) { this.dropdownOpen = true; } }   then when the user clicks the button, and the ui5-popover opens (due to its open property having been set to true), this popover might be partially or entirely &quot;cut&quot; or misplaced, depending on the position of the component on the page.  Example 1:  &lt;body&gt; &lt;my-select&gt;&lt;/my-select&gt; &lt;/body&gt;   Here the my-select component would work just fine as it is the only component on the page and no other components create a stacking context or overflow.  However, consider example 2:  &lt;body&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;height: 20px; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt; &lt;my-select&gt;&lt;/my-select&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt;   Now, when the popover opens, only a 20px-high strip of it would be visible due to the parent element's CSS.  This is an oversimplified example that could easily be fixed, but in real-world scenarios there are often parts of the HTML page we cannot influence which cause problems with popups.

Use the async getStaticAreaItemDomRef() method to create the static area item on demand, whenever necessary.  class MySelect extends UI5Element { ... async onOpenDropdownClick() { await this.getStaticAreaItemDomRef(); // this line is new compared to the old implementation this.dropdownOpen = true; } }   This is all it takes to make your component work with the static area.  Important: please note that the static area item is only created on demand - when you call the async getStaticAreaItemDomRef() function. For most components this is when the user opens a menu/dropdown/hovers over an element for a tooltip, etc.  Let's go over the whole process in more detail:  The browser renders a &lt;my-select&gt;&lt;/my-select&gt; component:  &lt;body&gt; &lt;my-select&gt;&lt;/my-select&gt; &lt;/body&gt;   The shadow root of the my-select component will be created with the content from the MySelect.hbs template, as it was provided as static get template(). Note that until this point nothing related to the static area has happened. The lifecycle of this component so far is not much different than that of a ui5-button.  The user interacts with the component (clicks the &quot;Dropdown&quot; button)  This will trigger the onOpenDropdownClick event handler we've bound in MySelect.hbsand once the first line of this event handler is executed (the await this.getStatiAreaItemDomRef part):  async onOpenDropdownClick() { await this.getStaticAreaItemDomRef(); this.dropdownOpen = true; }   the framework will create the ui5-static-area and a ui5-static-area-item and will create its shadow root with the content from the MySelectDropdown.hbs template, as it was provided as static get staticAreaTemplate().  The DOM would then look like this:  &lt;body&gt; &lt;ui5-static-area&gt; &lt;ui5-static-area-item&gt; #shadow-root &lt;!-- The MySelectDropdown.hbs template was rendered here --&gt; &lt;/ui5-static-area-item&gt; &lt;/ui5-static-area&gt; &lt;my-select&gt; #shadow-root &lt;!-- The MySelect.hbs template was rendered here --&gt; &lt;/my-select&gt; &lt;/body&gt;   If the user hadn't clicked the button, the static area part would not have been created at all.

For example, the following is not allowed:  &lt;{{tag}} {{attr}}=&quot;Hello&quot;&gt;This will not compile&lt;/{{tag}}&gt;   You can access object properties:  In the Demo.js file:  this.person = { name: &quot;John&quot;, lastName: &quot;Smith&quot; }   In the Demo.hbs file:  &lt;p&gt;{{person.name}} {{person.lastName}}&lt;/p&gt;   but you cannot use expressions inside .hbs templates. The following is not allowed:  &lt;p&gt;{{person.name + &quot; &quot; + person.lastName}}&lt;/p&gt;   Instead, you should precalculate the required value in the .js file and use it directly in the template:  In the Demo.js file:  get fullName() { return `${this.person.name} ${this.person.lastName}`; }   In the Demo.hbs file:  &lt;p&gt;{{fullName}}&lt;/p&gt;   By default, all content that you pass is escaped for security purposes. However, you can pass arbitrary HTML with {{{ and }}}:  In the Demo.js file:  this.unsafeMessage = `&lt;span&gt;This is unsafe content&lt;/span&gt;`;   In the Demo.hbs file:  &lt;p&gt;{{{unsafeMessage}}}&lt;/p&gt;   The result in DOM would be:  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is unsafe content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   Note: Using {{{ and }}} is strongly discouraged and should be avoided whenever possible. If you must use it, make sure you've sanitized your HTML manually beforehand. A common use-case for the {{{ and }}} binding is to manually add &lt;strong&gt; tags to parts of a string to implement highlighting while the user is typing. Here's an example:  In the Demo.js file:  this.userInput = `&lt;strong&gt;Arg&lt;/strong&gt;entina`;   In the Demo.hbs file:  &lt;div&gt;{{{userInput}}}&lt;/div&gt;   Thus, if the user has typed &quot;Arg&quot; (while typing &quot;Argentina&quot;), this part of the name will be highlighted.  Finally, it is possible to pass HTML elements (not just strings as in all examples above), and they will be rendered:  In the Demo.js file:  this.messageDiv = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); this.messageDiv.textContent = &quot;Hello&quot;;   In the Demo.hbs file:  &lt;p&gt;{{messageDiv}}&lt;/p&gt;   The result in DOM would be:  &lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   Note: This is not to be confused with {{{ and }}}. The {{{ and }}} binding expects a string, containing HTML, while the example above demonstrates passing an HTML element (hence Object, not String) directly.  Note: Although this technique is allowed and has its uses (such as cloning slotted elements to another component), passing HTML directly is strongly discouraged. The best practice is to always write your HTML explicitly in the template.

The individualSlots slot metadata configuration setting (see Understanding UI5 Web Components Metadata) allows you to have a separate physical slot for each child belonging to a certain slot.  However, setting individualSlots: true in the metadata configuration only creates an _individualSlot property on each element belonging to the slot, but does not create any slots automatically. The individual slots must be explicitly rendered by the developer in the .hbs template.  To do so, simply render a slot with a name property equal to the _individualSlot value for each child.  Here's an example:  In Demo.js (metadata object):  { slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { type: HTMLElement, propertyName: &quot;items&quot;, individualSlots: true } } }   Since propertyName is set to items, the children of the default slot will be accessible on the web component instance with this.items; and since individualSlots is set to true, every child in this.items (every child slotted in the default slot) will have an _individualSlots property created by the framework.  In Demo.hbs you must render a slot for each child with name equal to the _individualSlot property value for this child:  {{#each items}} &lt;div class=&quot;item-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;slot name=&quot;{{_individualSlot}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt; &lt;/div&gt; {{/each}}   The resulting DOM from the loop above will look like this:  &lt;div class=&quot;item-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;slot name=&quot;items-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;item-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;slot name=&quot;items-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;item-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;slot name=&quot;items-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   This allows you to have arbitrary DOM around each child and implement complex UX design, otherwise impossible if all children were just normally rendered next to each other in a single slot.

This doesn't imply that the property can be explicitly set to null or undefined unless explicitly stated.  For instance, if the value property of the ui5-combobox component is defined as optional with the type string (value?: string). This indicates that the property can be set with a string value or be absent/omitted.  However, setting it explicitly to null might lead to runtime errors because the component might not handle null values correctly. To ensure proper handling of optional properties, TypeScript offers a feature we suggest enabling called &quot;Exact Optional Property Types&quot;. See https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#exactOptionalPropertyTypes . When enabled, TypeScript enforces stricter rules regarding optional properties, ensuring that they can only be assigned values that are explicitly allowed by the type definition.  For instance, consider the following interface:  interface UserDefaults { colorThemeOverride?: &quot;dark&quot; | &quot;light&quot;; }   Without &quot;Exact Optional Property Types&quot; enabled, TypeScript allows setting colorThemeOverride to dark, light, or undefined. However, enabling &quot;Exact Optional Property Types&quot; ensures that only these values are permitted, disallowing null or other unexpected values.  In summary, it's essential to ensure that the a property of type string is handled according to its type definition (for example, by setting empty string, instead of null, where type is string), and if necessary, enable &quot;Exact Optional Property Types&quot; in TypeScript to enforce stricter rules regarding optional properties.

They are only modified by properties and attributes.  An example of such a Web Component is the ui5-icon:  &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;add&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-icon&gt;   The icon accepts no text or other HTML elements inside its opening and closing tags. Therefore, in the next example, the text inside the &lt;ui5-icon&gt; will be ignored.  &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;add&quot;&gt;This is an icon&lt;/ui5-icon&gt;   Other UI5 Web Components, such as &lt;ui5-button&gt; accept text (and in addition HTML elements that make sense when writing text).  &lt;ui5-button id=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;This is the content of the button&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;content&gt; of the button&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;This is the &lt;span class=&quot;myClass&quot;&gt;content&lt;span&gt; of the button&lt;/ui5-button&gt;   You can change the content of these elements with any suitable DOM API.  const myButton = document.getElementById(&quot;btn&quot;); myButton.textContent = &quot;New text&quot;; myButton.innerHTML = &quot;New text&quot;; // same effect as above myButton.childNodes[0].nodeValue = &quot;New text&quot; // same result again   Usually, you'll never have to do this manually either, as you'll bind the content of the button via the means provided by the framework you're using, and the framework will be the one updating it for you.  Finally, there are UI5 Web Components that only accept other HTML elements.  For example &lt;ui5-popover&gt; may contain any HTML element - standard elements and other custom elements alike.  &lt;ui5-popover&gt; &lt;div&gt;This is my content&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is some more content&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Button on a popover&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;/ui5-popover&gt;   Manipulating the content of such Web Components is done again with the standard DOM APIs.  For example, to add something else to the popover above:  const popover = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ui5-popover&quot;)[0]; const newChild = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); popover.appendChild(newChild);   Again, normally you won't need to do this manually, but your framework will do it for you.  Now, let's have a look at a Web Component that is intended to have only certain children:  &lt;ui5-tabcontainer id=&quot;tc1&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-tab text=&quot;Laptops&quot; additional-text=&quot;125&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab&gt; &lt;ui5-tab-separator&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab-separator&gt; &lt;ui5-tab text=&quot;Phones&quot; design=&quot;Positive&quot; additional-text=&quot;25&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab&gt; &lt;ui5-tab text=&quot;Tablets&quot; design=&quot;Negative&quot; additional-text=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab&gt; &lt;/ui5-tabcontainer&gt;   The &lt;ui5-tabcontainer&gt; should only contain &lt;ui5-tab&gt; and &lt;ui5-tab-separator&gt;.  The manipulation is exactly the same as with the other Web Components. For example, to add a new tab:  const tc = document.getElementById(&quot;tc1&quot;); const newTab = document.createElement(&quot;ui5-tab&quot;); newTab.text = &quot;Smart Watches&quot;; newTab.design = &quot;Positive&quot;; tc.appendChild(newTab);   And finally, some UI5 Web Components may render their children in different places, depending on the purpose of each child.  Let's have a look at the &lt;ui5-popover&gt; again. After consulting the documentation, we can see that this particular Web Component accepts three categories of children: default, footer, header. For footer and headerthe children can be any type of HTML Element (hence HTMLElement), while for default they can be both HTML Elements and text (hence Node).  To tell the &lt;ui5-popover&gt; which child goes where, use the slot attribute on it.  &lt;ui5-popover&gt; &lt;div slot=&quot;header&quot;&gt;This will be used as a header&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Some popover content&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Some more content&lt;/div&gt; This text will also go to the default slot. &lt;div slot=&quot;footer&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Do some action&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/ui5-popover&gt;   You do not have to supply the slot attribute for the default slot of any Web Component.  Also, since text nodes cannot have attributes in HTML, this also means that only the default slot can accept text (can be of type Node) and all text nodes go there. Every UI5 Web Component that has slots, has at least a default slot.  Here's a summary of slot types:  Slot Type\tAllowed Children\tExampleNode\tAll HTML elements and text\tui5-button default slot HTMLElement\tHTML elements only (no text)\tui5-popover header slot  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"4.

Like with most other tasks, you'll use your framework's syntax to bind to events, and you'll rarely, if ever, need to call addEventListener yourself.  Please, note, however that some frameworks (e.g. React) cannot use their standard syntax for binding to custom events (such as close), but only for standard ones (such as click). So, for custom events in React you'd have to get a reference to the element and call addEventListener manually.  For more information, please check our React tutorial.

Finally, the icon can be used anywhere.  &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;custom/backery-dining&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-icon&gt; &lt;ui5-avatar icon=&quot;custom/backery-dining&quot; size=&quot;XS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-avatar&gt;   Tip: for multi-colored icons, you can specify multiple SVG elements and put a fill/color attribute with a specific value on each element.  &lt;g fill=&quot;none&quot; stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; stroke-width=&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;path stroke-linecap=&quot;round&quot; stroke-linejoin=&quot;round&quot; d=&quot;M11 3.055A9.001 9.001 0 1020.945 13H11V3.055z&quot; fill=&quot;aqua&quot;/&gt; &lt;path stroke-linecap=&quot;round&quot; stroke-linejoin=&quot;round&quot; d=&quot;M20.488 9H15V3.512A9.025 9.025 0 0120.488 9z&quot; /&gt; &lt;/g&gt;  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Release Management","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/webcomponents/v1/docs/Release Management/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Release Strategy​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Release Management","url":"/webcomponents/v1/docs/Release Management/#release-strategy","content":" The UI5 Web Components follow the well-known NPM Semantic Versioning strategyand produce the following type of releases:  Patch releases  Includes backward compatible bug fixes and increments the third digit, e.g. 1.0.1.

This is the reason why the toolbar must operate with abstract items. Abstract items are not rendered directly within the DOM; instead, they function as data used by the toolbar to produce corresponding physical web components. On the other hand, useful modifications detected by the toolbar on the physical items are synchronised with the abstract ones. (see step Events) The ui5-toolbar is a composite web component, that slots different UI5 components, designing them as abstract items. They can contain properties, slots and events, and they can match the API of already existing component. In order to be suitable for usage inside ui5-toolbar, each component should adhere to following guidelines:  The component needs to implement a class with component name of the following type:  ToolbarButton.ts   The new component needs to implement two template files with name of the following type:  ToolbarButton.hbs and ToolbarPopoverButton.hbs   It needs to implement customElement decorator, which is good to contain custom tag name:  @customElement({ tag: &quot;ui5-toolbar-button&quot; })   The class should extend ToolbarItem base class, which should also be added as a dependency.  class ToolbarButton extends ToolbarItem   Inside the module there should be two template getters: for toolbar and popover representation.  static get toolbarTemplate() { return ToolbarButtonTemplate; } static get toolbarPopoverTemplate() { return ToolbarPopoverButtonTemplate; }   After the class declaration there should be a registry call for the item inside the toolbar. registerToolbarItem helper should be added as a dependency.  import { registerToolbarItem } from &quot;./ToolbarRegistry.js&quot;;   registerToolbarItem(ToolbarButton);   In the templates there should be mapping of the properties that need to be used in the component inside Toolbar.  Inside ToolbarButton.ts:   @property() text!: string; @property({ type: Boolean }) disabled!: boolean;    Inside ToolbarButtonTemplate.hbs:   &lt;ui5-button class=&quot;ui5-tb-item&quot; ?disabled=&quot;{{this.disabled}}&quot; data-ui5-external-action-item-id=&quot;{{this._id}}&quot; data-ui5-stable=&quot;{{this.stableDomRef}}&quot; &gt; {{this.text}} &lt;/ui5-button&gt;   The new component's DOM root element needs to have &quot;ui5-tb-item&quot; CSS class in order to get default styles for item (margins etc.).The new class needs to be added to the bundle file in the corresponding library.  Inside bundle.common.js:  import ToolbarButton from &quot;./dist/ToolbarButton.js&quot;;   Use your newly created component inside the ui5-toolbar like this:  &lt;ui5-toolbar&gt; &lt;ui5-toolbar-button text=&quot;Button 1&quot; disabled&gt;&lt;/ui5-toolbar-button&gt; &lt;ui5-toolbar-button text=&quot;Button 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-toolbar-button&gt; &lt;/ui5-toolbar&gt;   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Events​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating a web component abstract item to be used inside Toolbar","url":"/webcomponents/v1/docs/internal/Toolbar/#events","content":"  Abstract items can provide a map of events through the subscribedEvents getter. The toolbar will actively monitor these events on the physical items, and when triggered, it will also fire the information to the corresponding abstract item. This mechanism proves useful when the abstract item requires synchronization of changes or interactions with the physical items. Importantly, events described as public offer benefits to consumers of the abstract items informing them about interactions with the physical elements. Additionally, the map contains information about the popover, such as preventClosing: true, which ensures that the popover remains open when this event is triggered by the physical item. A good example is the Map of the ui5-toolbar-select:   get subscribedEvents() { const map = new Map(); map.set(&quot;click&quot;, { preventClosing: true }); map.set(&quot;change&quot;, { preventClosing: false }); map.set(&quot;open&quot;, { preventClosing: true }); map.set(&quot;close&quot;, { preventClosing: true }); return map; }    The ui5-toolbar-select then waits for the toolbar to fire the change event, in order to notify (synchronize) its options slots:   _onEventHandler(e: Event): void { if (e.type === &quot;change&quot;) { // update options const selectedOption = (e as CustomEvent&lt;ToolbarSelectChangeEventDetail&gt;).detail.selectedOption; const selectedOptionIndex = Number(selectedOption?.getAttribute(&quot;data-ui5-external-action-item-index&quot;)); this.options.forEach((option: Option, index: number) =&gt; { if (index === selectedOptionIndex) { option.setAttribute(&quot;selected&quot;, &quot;&quot;); } else { option.removeAttribute(&quot;selected&quot;); } }); } }  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"}],"options":{"id":"default"}}
