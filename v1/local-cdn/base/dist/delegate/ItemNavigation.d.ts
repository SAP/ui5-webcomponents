/**
 * The ItemNavigation class manages the calculations to determine the correct "tabindex" for a group of related items inside a root component.
 * Important: ItemNavigation only does the calculations and does not change "tabindex" directly, this is a responsibility of the developer.
 *
 * The keys that trigger ItemNavigation are:
 *  - Up/down
 *  - Left/right
 *  - Home/End
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1) Use the "getItemsCallback" constructor property to pass a callback to ItemNavigation, which, whenever called, will return the list of items to navigate among.
 *
 * Each item passed to ItemNavigation via "getItemsCallback" must be:
 *  - A) either a UI5Element with a "forcedTabIndex" property
 *  - B) or an Object with "id" and "forcedTabIndex" properties which represents a part of the root component's shadow DOM.
 *    The "id" must be a valid ID within the shadow root of the component ItemNavigation operates on.
 *    This object must not be a DOM object because, as said, ItemNavigation will not set "tabindex" on it. It must be a representation of a DOM object only
 *    and the developer has the responsibility to update the "tabindex" in the component's DOM.
 *  - C) a combination of the above
 *
 * Whenever the user navigates with the keyboard, ItemNavigation will modify the "forcedTabIndex" properties of the items.
 * It is the items' responsibilities to re-render themselves and apply the correct value of "tabindex" (i.e. to map the "forcedTabIndex" ItemNavigation set to them to the "tabindex" property).
 * If the items of the ItemNavigation are UI5Elements themselves, this can happen naturally since they will be invalidated by their "forcedTabIndex" property.
 * If the items are Objects with "id" and "forcedTabIndex" however, it is the developer's responsibility to apply these and the easiest way is to have the root component invalidated by ItemNavigation.
 * To do so, set the "affectedPropertiesNames" constructor property to point to one or more of the root component's properties that need refreshing when "forcedTabIndex" is changed deeply.
 *
 * 2) Call the "setCurrentItem" method of ItemNavigation whenever you want to change the current item.
 * This is most commonly required if the user for example clicks on an item and thus selects it directly.
 * Pass as the only argument to "setCurrentItem" the item that becomes current (must be one of the items, returned by "getItemsCallback").

     *  - behavior (Static|Cycling): tells what to do when trying to navigate beyond the first and last items
     *    Static means that nothing happens if the user tries to navigate beyond the first/last item.
