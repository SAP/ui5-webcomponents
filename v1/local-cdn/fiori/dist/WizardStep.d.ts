/**
 * @class
 *
 * ### Overview
 *
 * A component that represents a logical step as part of the `ui5-wizard`.
 * It is meant to aggregate arbitrary HTML elements that form the content of a single step.
 *
 * ### Structure
 *
 * - Each wizard step has arbitrary content.
 * - Each wizard step might have texts - defined by the `titleText` and `subtitleText` properties.
 * - Each wizard step might have an icon - defined by the `icon` property.
 * - Each wizard step might display a number in place of the `icon`, when it's missing.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * The `ui5-wizard-step` component should be used only as slot of the `ui5-wizard` component
 * and should not be used standalone.
 * @constructor
 * @extends UI5Element
 * @abstract
 * @since 1.0.0-rc.10
 * @public
 * @slot {Node[]} default - Defines the step content.
