 *
 * ### Overview
 * The `ui5-time-picker` component provides an input field with assigned clocks which are opened on user action.
 * The `ui5-time-picker` allows users to select a localized time using touch, mouse, or keyboard input.
 * It consists of two parts: the time input field and the clocks.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * The user can enter a time by:
 *
 * - Using the clocks that are displayed in a popup
 * - Typing it in directly in the input field
 *
 * When the user makes an entry and chooses the enter key, the clocks show the corresponding time (hours, minutes and seconds separately).
 * When the user directly triggers the clocks display, the actual time is displayed.
 * For the `ui5-time-picker`
 *
 * ### Formatting
 *
 * If a time is entered by typing it into
 * the input field, it must fit to the used time format.
 *
 * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation.
 * For more information, see [UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup Language](http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).
 *
 * For example, if the `format-pattern` is "HH:mm:ss",
 * a valid value string is "11:42:35" and the same is displayed in the input.
 *
 * ### Keyboard handling
 * [F4], [Alt]+[Up], [Alt]+[Down] Open/Close picker dialog and move focus to it.
 *
 * When closed:
 *
 * - [Page Up] - Increments hours by 1. If 12 am is reached, increment hours to 1 pm and vice versa.
 * - [Page Down] - Decrements the corresponding field by 1. If 1 pm is reached, decrement hours to 12 am and vice versa.
 * - [Shift]+[Page Up] - Increments minutes by 1.
 * - [Shift]+[Page Down] - Decrements minutes by 1.
 * - [Shift]+[Ctrl]+[Page Up] - Increments seconds by 1.
 * - [Shift]+[Ctrl]+[Page Down] - Decrements seconds by 1.

 *
 * When opened:
 *
 * - [Page Up] - Increments hours by 1. If 12 am is reached, increment hours to 1 pm and vice versa.
