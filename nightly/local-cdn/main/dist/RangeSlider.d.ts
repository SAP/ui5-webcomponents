/**
 * @class
 *
 * ### Overview
 * Represents a numerical interval and two handles (grips) to select a sub-range within it.
 * The purpose of the component to enable visual selection of sub-ranges within a given interval.
 *
 * ### Structure
 * The most important properties of the Range Slider are:
 *
 * - min - The minimum value of the slider range.
 * - max - The maximum value of the slider range.
 * - value - The current value of the slider.
 * - step - Determines the increments in which the slider will move.
 * - showTooltip - Determines if a tooltip should be displayed above the handle.
 * - showTickmarks - Displays a visual divider between the step values.
 * - labelInterval - Labels some or all of the tickmarks with their values.
 *
 * #### Notes:
 *
 * - The right and left handle can be moved individually and their positions could therefore switch.
 * - The entire range can be moved along the interval.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * The most common use case is to select and move sub-ranges on a continuous numerical scale.
 *
 * ### Responsive Behavior
 * You can move the currently selected range by clicking on it and dragging it along the interval.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * - `Left or Down Arrow` - Moves a component's handle or the entire selection one step to the left;
 * - `Right or Up Arrow` - Moves a component's handle or the entire selection one step to the right;
 * - `Left or Down Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd` - Moves a component's handle to the left or the entire range with step equal to 1/10th of the entire range;
 * - `Right or Up Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd` - Moves a component's handle to the right or the entire range with step equal to 1/10th of the entire range;
 * - `Plus` - Same as `Right or Up Arrow`;
 * - `Minus` - Same as `Left or Down Arrow`;
 * - `Home` - Moves the entire selection or the selected handle to the beginning of the component's range;
 * - `End` - Moves the entire selection or the selected handle to the end of the component's range;
 * - `Page Up` - Same as `Right or Up Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd`;
 * - `Page Down` - Same as `Left or Down Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd`;
 * - `Escape` - Resets the `startValue` and `endValue` properties to the values prior the component focusing;
 *
