/**
 * @class
 *
 * ### Overview
 *
 * The `ui5-toast` is a small, non-disruptive popup for success or information messages that
 * disappears automatically after a few seconds.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * #### When to use:
 *
 * - You want to display a short success or information message.
 * - You do not want to interrupt users while they are performing an action.
 * - You want to confirm a successful action.
 *
 * #### When not to use:
 *
 * - You want to display error or warning message.
 * - You want to interrupt users while they are performing an action.
 * - You want to make sure that users read the message before they leave the page.
 * - You want users to be able to copy some part of the message text.
 *
 * ### ES6 Module Import
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Toast.js";`
 * @constructor
 * @extends UI5Element
 * @public
 * @since 1.0.0-rc.6
 * @slot {Array<Node>} default
 * Defines the text of the component.
 *
 * **Note:** Although this slot accepts HTML Elements, it is strongly recommended that you only use text in order to preserve the intended design.
