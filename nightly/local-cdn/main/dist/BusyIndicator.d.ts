/**
 * @class
 *
 * ### Overview
 *
 * The `ui5-busy-indicator` signals that some operation is going on and that the
 * user must wait. It does not block the current UI screen so other operations could be triggered in parallel.
 * It displays 3 dots and each dot expands and shrinks at a different rate, resulting in a cascading flow of animation.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * For the `ui5-busy-indicator` you can define the size, the text and whether it is shown or hidden.
 * In order to hide it, use the "active" property.
 *
 * In order to show busy state over an HTML element, simply nest the HTML element in a `ui5-busy-indicator` instance.
 *
 * **Note:** Since `ui5-busy-indicator` has `display: inline-block;` by default and no width of its own,
 * whenever you need to wrap a block-level element, you should set `display: block` to the busy indicator as well.
 *
 * #### When to use:
 *
 * - The user needs to be able to cancel the operation.
 * - Only part of the application or a particular component is affected.
 *
 * #### When not to use:
 *
 * - The operation takes less than one second.
 * - You need to block the screen and prevent the user from starting another activity.
 * - Do not show multiple busy indicators at once.
 *
 * ### ES6 Module Import
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/BusyIndicator.js";`
 * @constructor
 * @extends UI5Element
 * @public
 * @slot {Array<Node>} default - Determines the content over which the component will appear.
