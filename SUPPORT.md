## 🔍 Analyzing Issues
Analyzing issue reports can be a lot of effort. Any help is welcome! 👍

Go to [the Github issue tracker](https://github.com/UI5/webcomponents/issues?state=open) and find an open issue which needs additional work or a bugfix.
Especially check for issues with the labels **`good first issue`**, **`help wanted`**, or **`information required`**.

You may be able to add additional or missing information, such as a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce an issue or an analysis of the root cause. In case of the latter, you might even be able to [contribute](/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-contribute) a bugfix. 🙌

## 📝 Reporting Issues
### Not a Bug / Questions
If you need help setting something up, or if you have questions regarding the UI5 Web Components, please seek help on a community platform like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ui5-webcomponents) or the `#webcomponents` channel of the [OpenUI5 Community Slack](https://ui5-slack-invite.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/).

### Requirements for a Bug Report
You are encouraged to use the issue templates for a [bug](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) or [feature request](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

1. **Only UI5 Web Components issues**
    * Please do not report:
        * Issues caused by dependencies or plugins.
        * Issues caused by the use of non-public/internal methods. Only the public methods listed in the API documentation may be used.
        * Something you do not get to work properly, see [Not a Bug / Questions](#not-a-bug--questions).
2. **No duplicate**: You have searched the [issue tracker](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+repo%3ASAP%2Fui5-webcomponents) to make sure the bug has not yet been reported.
3. **Good summary**: The summary should be specific to the issue.
4. **Current bug**: The bug can be reproduced in the most current version.
5. **Reproducible bug**: There are step-by-step instructions provided on how to reproduce the issue.
6. **Well-documented**:
    * Precisely state the expected and the actual behavior.
    * Give information about the environment in which the issue occurs (OS/Platform, version, etc.).
    * Generally, give as much additional information as possible.
8. **Only one bug per report**: Open additional tickets for additional issues.
9. **Please report bugs in English.**

### Use of Labels
GitHub offers labels to categorize issues. The labels can only be set and modified by committers.

##### General issue categories:
* **`bug`**: This issue is a bug in the code.
* **`documentation`**: This issue is about wrong documentation.
* **`enhancement`**: This is not a bug report, but an enhancement request.

##### Status of an open issue:
* **`information required`**: The author is required to provide information.
* **`good first issue`**: A newcomer may work on this.
* **`help wanted`**: Additional help in analyzing this issue is appreciated.

##### Status/resolution of a closed issue:
* **`duplicate`**: The issue was already reported somewhere else.
* **`invalid`**: For any reason, this issue report will not be handled further. Possible reasons are lack of information, or that the issue does not apply anymore.
* **`wontfix`**: While acknowledged to be an issue, a fix cannot or will not be provided.

### Issue Reporting Disclaimer
We want to improve the quality of the UI5 Web Components and good bug reports are welcome! But our capacity is limited, so we cannot handle questions or consultation requests, and we cannot afford to ask for required details.

Therefore, we reserve the right to close or to not process insufficient bug reports in favor of those which are clearly documented and easy to reproduce. Even though we would like to solve each well-documented issue, there is always the chance that it won't happen - please remember: The UI5 Web Components is Open Source and comes without warranty.

Bug report analysis support is always very welcome! See [Analyzing Issues](#-analyzing-issues).
