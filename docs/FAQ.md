# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How can I play with UI5 Web Components easily?**

**A:** Use this [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/71r1x5o51q?fontsize=14&module=%2Findex.html).


**Q: Where is the documentation?**

**A:** There are several resources:
- [Web Components APIs](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/)
- [How to get started?](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/04/01/the-fastest-way-to-get-started-with-ui5-web-components/)

**Q: Is there a CDN to load UI5 Web Components from?**

**A:** No. The best practice is to build your own bundle. See [this article](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/04/01/the-fastest-way-to-get-started-with-ui5-web-components/) for details.


**Q: Are UI5 Web Components APIs stable?**

**A:** Mostly yes since the project is in Release Candidate state, but minor changes may still be expected until the official release.


**Q: Can I create my own UI5 Web Components?**

**A:** Yes, for more information see [Creating a Custom UI5 Web Components Package](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/blob/master/docs/5-development/01-custom-UI5-Web-Components-Packages.md)


**Q: How big is the runtime?**

**A:** Currently on master, a simple working Web Component (```ui5-label```) and its dependencies equals to around 22K gzipped. 
Two simple web components (```ui5-label``` and ```ui5-icon```) and their dependencies equal to around 25K gzipped.

**Note:** The quoted numbers include only a ```<ui5-label>``` (respectively ```ui5-label``` and ```ui5-icon```) working on Chrome/FF/Safari with the default settings (theme/language).
Additional features, settings and old browser support will increase bundle size accordingly.


**Q: What is the difference between UI5 Web Components and OpenUI5?**
**A:** See the project's [readme.md](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) for more on this.


**Q: Can I use UI5 Web Components in an OpenUI5 application?**
**A:** This is not necessary as OpenUI5 already provides equivalents in the form of UI5 Controls. 


**Q: How can I hide not yet upgraded Web Components so that users don't see them until styled?**
**A:** You can place a CSS rule such as:

```CSS
*:not(:defined) {
	display: none;
}
``` 

or: 

```CSS
*:not(:defined) {
	visibility: hidden;
}
``` 

in your application, depending on your preference.

The selector `*:not(:defined)` will match all web components that haven't been defined yet. 

Alternatively, you could only apply this rule for selected web components:

```CSS
ui5-button:not(:defined), ui5-label:not(:defined) {
	display: none;
}
``` 

Please note that the `:defined` CSS pseudo-selector is not supported by the Edge and Internet Explorer 11 browsers.
