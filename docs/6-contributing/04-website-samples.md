# Creating Website Samples

The website app is developed in its own package `packages/website`. Components features or states are demonstrated via samples meant for consumers.
The samples are placed in the `/packages/website/docs/_samples` folder.

**For example:** 
The Button samples can be found in the `/packages/website/docs/_samples/main/Button` folder.


## Run the Website

Runs project build + website start.

```bash
yarn start:website
```

However, in most cases you have the project built, so it would be faster
to just start the website:

```bash
cd packages/website
yarn start
```

**Note:** In case of issues with the second flow, most likely you need `yarn build` in the root.


## Create New Sample

A regular component sample consists of a folder + 3 files (`{sample_name}.md`, `main.js` and `sample.html`) that you need to create. Let's go trough every one of them:

### The `main.js` file

In the `main.js` file, we import the components and assets (icons, illustration) required by the sample.

**For example:**
```ts
import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js";
import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/edit.js";
import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/account.js";
```

### The `sample.html` file

In the `sample.html` file, we use the web components as in regular HTML page.

**For example:**

```html
<!-- playground-fold -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Sample</title>
</head>

<body style="background-color: var(--sapBackgroundColor)">
    <!-- playground-fold-end -->

    <ui5-button icon="sap-icon://edit" design="Default" tooltip="Edit Button"></ui5-button>
    <ui5-button icon="sap-icon://account" design="Transparent" tooltip="Account Button"></ui5-button>
    <!-- playground-fold -->
    <script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
<!-- playground-fold-end -->

```


**Note:** The `playground-fold` comments will fold this part of the code to highlight the important part - the components usage.

### The `{sample_name}.md` file

In the `.md` file we instantiate the `Editor` component (file editor + preview) that will display your sample and show the code behind it.

**For example:**
```md
import html from '!!raw-loader!./sample.html';
import js from '!!raw-loader!./main.js';

<Editor html={html} js={js} />
```


## Show the Sample

In the previous step we have created our sample. Now, it's time to show and document it.


- Open the `packages/website/docs/_components_pages` folder.

- Find your component's `.mdx` file.

**For example:** `packages/website/docs/_components_pages/main/Button.mdx`

- Import the newly created sample.

**For example:** 
```js
import MyNewSample from "../../_samples/main/Button/MyNewSample/MyNewSample.md";`
```

- Instantiate the sample and add title + description.

**For example:**

```.md
### My New Sample
The Button supports several designs to indicate the priority or the nature of the action.

<MyNewSample />

```

**Note:** Changes in the sample files (`.md`, `.html`, `.js`) are detected and the server reloads. However, changes in the `.mdx` file are not watched - restart of the server is needed.

## Conventions 

### Sample Name

- The sample name and the folder that includes the sample files should match the `.md` file name (`Button/IconOnly/IconOnly.md`). 

- Regarding the naming, it's best to consult with KM and use existing ones as reference.

### Sample Title and Description
The title ("My New Sample") and the description ("The Button..") will be displayed at the top of the sample itself. Adding title and description is recommended -  they help viewers better understand what they are looking at.


### Sample Order
Add new samples in the "More Samples" section where it best fits among the existing samples.


### The "Basic" Sample
All components have a sample called "Basic" used as the first sample displayed right-after the component's overview. Don't use "Basic" for other samples.
