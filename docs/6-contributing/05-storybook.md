# Running Storybook Locally
The project has storybook in additon to the website, suitable for internal testing, rather than end-users.

The [deployed](https://ui5.github.io/webcomponents/storybook) storybook can be run locally to test your changes and samples.
In order to do so, you have to follow the steps below:

## 1. Install dependencies.
In the root directory run:
```bash
yarn
```

## 2. Start the storybook locally
In your terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
yarn start:storybook
```

This will build all the necessary assets and will start local server on your machine. To access the storybook, visit: http://localhost:6006/
