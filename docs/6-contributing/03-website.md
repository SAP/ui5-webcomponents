# Running Wesbsite Locally

The UI5 Web Components Website app is the entry point of the UI5 Web Components project. 
The app includes documentation, API reference and samples for all the available web components.

The website can be run locally to test your changes and samples.
In order to do so, you have to follow the steps below:

In your terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
yarn
yarn start:website
```

This will build all the necessary assets and will start local server on your machine
and finally open the website in your browser.
