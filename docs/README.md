## Ecosystem

UI5 Web Components are complemented by a range of related projects that enhance the development experience even further. These projects build on top of the core UI5 Web Components, providing additional functionalities and integrations tailored to specific frameworks and use cases.

### UI5 Web Components for React

[UI5 Web Components for React](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react) is a wrapper implementation around UI5 Web Components which makes using them in React even more comfortable. The current version of React (`react 18`) has some shortcomings when it comes to handling Custom Elements, namely the binding of `boolean` attributes as well as adding event listeners to custom event names like `selection-change`. With the help of UI5 Web Components for React, you can use the UI5 Web Components in React as if they were native React components. In addition to that, this library is also offering some complex layout components built on top of UI5 Web Components as well as Charting Components.

**Note:** [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19) promises to fill all gaps in the web coponents support - the binding of `boolean` attributes and subscribing to custom events.

### UI5 Web Components for Angular

[UI5 Web Components for Angular](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-ngx) is a wrapper implementation around UI5 Web Components which to make it work with Angular without needing to use the `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` or `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` schemas.
Moreover, all Angular-specific features, such as two-way data binding and Angular Form support, work out of the box.
