# First Steps

*This section explains how to get started with UI5 Web Components.*

## Distribution Model

UI5 Web Components are distributed as **ES6 modules** across several **NPM packages**:

The most commonly used ones are:
 - `@ui5/webcomponents` - components library, containing bread-and-butter components (buttons, inputs, pickers, etc.);
 - `@ui5/webcomponents-fiori` - components library, containing semantic, higher-order components;
 - `@ui5/webcomponents-icons` - icons collection, containing general-purpose and business-oriented icons.

**Important: There is no CDN for UI5 Web Components**. Each application is expected to **import** and **bundle** only the components (and any other resources) it is going to use.

## Bundling UI5 Web Components

To build your UI5 Web Components project you can use any bundling tool that supports the following features:
 - `.json` imports;
 - dynamic ES6 imports.

This is true of all modern bundlers.  

UI5 Web Components are shipped as ES6 modules and published on NPM. If you are already using a framework that handles bundling of ES6 modules, skip forward to [Installation](#installation) or check the Tutorials section.

### Creating a Project

You can use any ES6 module-capable front-end tooling, but in case you don’t have a preference yet, you can start a new project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). The only prerequisite is to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```console
npm init vite
```

- Select a project name: `my-webcomponents-app`
- Select a framework: `vanilla`
- Select a variant: `JavaScript`

This command will create a project structure under `my-webcomponents-app`. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the initial depenednecies and start a dev server.

```
cd my-webcomponents-app
npm install
npm run dev​
```

You should see a message that a server is running on `Local: http://localhost:3000/`. Launch your favourite IDE and change some code, the browser page will be automatically refreshed.

### Installation

<a name="installation"></a>

Install ```@ui5/webcomponents```

```bash
npm install @ui5/webcomponents
```

This command downloads the published source code of the UI5 Web Components to the `node_modules` folder. Now, you can add them to your code to get them on the web page.

### Documentation

Take a look at the available UI5 Web Components documentation in the [playground](./playground/docs/).

### Usage

#### 1. Import the needed Web Component.

```js
// src/main.js
import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js";
```

This line runs the code that registers the `<ui5-button>` tag with the browser. Now, when the browser sees such a tag, it knows how to render it.

#### 2. Instantiate the Web Component.

Next, change the application markup in the same file to display the button on the page:
```js
// src/main.js
...
document.querySelector('#app').innerHTML = `
  <ui5-button>Hello UI5 Web Components</ui5-button>
`
```

Check the browser to see the displayed button. You can now use UI5 Web Components just like normal HTML elements - set attributes on them, attach events, and more as described in the documentation.

#### 3. Run a production build.

If you want to deploy your project on a static hosting or in a Node.js project, run:

```console
npm run build
```

The output will show what files were created along with their sizes:

```console
vite v2.3.4 building for production...
✓ 99 modules transformed.

```

The contents of the `dist` folder is ready to be deployed for productive usage. The hashes in the file names make them safe for caching and the produced bundle is optimized for production.

#### 4. Enjoy UI5 Web Components.
