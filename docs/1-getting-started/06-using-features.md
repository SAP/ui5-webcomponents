# Using Additional Features

*Several UI5 Web Components packages offer **additional features**. This section explains what these are and how to use them.*

## What Are Additional Features

These are features that **logically belong** to a component, but are not needed for the component's most common use cases, thus not part of the component's code by default.

The goal of features is to keep the components' code base minimal and allow users greater flexibility over what code to bundle.

If you intend to use a component's additional feature, your app must import it explicitly.

## Importing Additional Features

Import the feature file from the respective NPM package:

`import "@ui5/<PACKAGE-NAME>/dist/features/<FEATURE-NAME>.js`

Currently, only a few components offer additional features:
