# Events

In this article, we will discuss events in the context of UI5 Web Components.

Components use `CustomEvent` to inform developers of important state changes in the components. For example, the `change` event is fired whenever the value of a `ui5-input` is changed.

## The `@event` Decorator

To define your own custom event, you need to use the `@event` decorator.

The `event` decorator is a class decorator that takes one required argument as a string to define the event name and an optional argument as an object literal to describe details of the custom element.

The details object allows developers to describe more information about the event.

```ts
import UI5Element from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js";
import customElement from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/customElement.js";
import event from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/event.js";

@customElement("my-demo-component")
@event("change", {
	detail: {
		valid: { type: Boolean },
	},
})
class MyDemoComponent extends UI5Element {}
```

**Note:** This decorator is used only to describe the events of the component and is not meant to create emitters.

## Usage

As mentioned earlier, the `@event` decorator doesn't create event emitters. To notify developers of component changes, we have to fire events ourselves. This can be done using the `fireEvent` and the newer `fireDecoratorEvent` methods that comes from the `UI5Element` class. The difference between the methods is explained below.

```ts
import UI5Element from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js";
import customElement from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/customElement.js";
import property from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/property.js";
import event from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/event.js";

@customElement("my-demo-component")
@event("change")
class MyDemoComponent extends UI5Element {
    @property()
    value = "";

    onNativeInputChange(e) {
        this.value = e.target.value;
        this.fireDecoratorEvent("change"); // or this.fireEvent("change");
    }
}
```

**Note:** By default, the `fireDecoratorEvent` (and `fireEvent`) method returns a boolean value that helps you understand whether the event was canceled (i.e., if the `preventDefault` method was called).

## Event Detail

The `@event` decorator is generic and accepts a TypeScript type that describes its detail. This type is crucial for preventing incorrect detail data when the event is fired using `fireDecoratorEvent` and `fireEvent` methods (both generic) and for ensuring type safety when listening for the event, so you know what kind of detail data to expect.

**Note:** It's required to export all types that describe specific event details for all public events.

Here's an example implementation:

```typescript
import UI5Element from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js";
import customElement from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/customElement.js";
import property from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/property.js";
import event from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/event.js";

// Define the event detail type
export type MyDemoComponentChangeEventDetail = {
    valid: boolean;
};

@customElement("my-demo-component")
@event<MyDemoComponentChangeEventDetail>("change", {
    detail: {
        valid: { type: Boolean },
    },
})
class MyDemoComponent extends UI5Element {
    @property()
    value = "";

    onNativeInputChange(e: Event) {
        this.fireDecoratorEvent<MyDemoComponentChangeEventDetail>("change", {
            valid: true,
        });
    }
}

export { MyDemoComponent };
```

## Event Configuration

### Bubbling and Preventing

Whether the events should be cancelable or able to bubble is configurable.
by setting `cancelable` and `bubbles` in the `@event` decorator.

- `cancelable: true` means the event can be prevented by calling the native `preventDefault()` method in the event handler- by default it's `false`.

- `bubbles: true` means the event will bubble - by default it's `false`.

Since `v2.4.0` this can be configured in the `@event` decorator:

```ts
import UI5Element from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js";
import customElement from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/customElement.js";
import event from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/decorators/event.js";

@customElement("my-demo-component")
@event("change", {
    bubbles: true // false by default
    cancelable: true // false by default
})
class MyDemoComponent extends UI5Element {

    onSomeAction() {
        this.fireDecoratorEvent("change")
    }
}
```

### The `fireDecoratorEvent` method

The method is available since version `v2.4.0` and it fires a custom event and gets the configuration for the event from the `@event` decorator. In case you rely on the decorator settings, you must use the `fireDecoratorEvent` method.

Keep in mind that `cancelable` and `bubbles` are `false` by default and you must explicitly enable them in the `@event` decorator if required.

- Fire event with default configuration

```ts
@event("change")
```

```ts
// Fires the event as NOT preventable and NOT bubbling
this.fireDecoratorEvent("change");
```

- Fire event with non-default configuration

```ts
@event("change", {
    bubbles: true // false by default
    cancelable: true // false by default
})
```

```ts
// Fires the event as preventable and bubbling
this.fireDecoratorEvent("change");
```

**Note:** since `v2.4.0` it's recommended to describe the event in the `@event` decorator and use the `fireDecoratorEvent` method. 

### The `fireEvent` method

The method is available since the very beginning of the project and like `fireDecoratorEvent` fires a custom event, but does not consider the settings in the `@event` decorator. So, if you set `cancelable` and `bubbles` in the `@event` decorator, but fire the component events via `fireEvent`, the configured values won't be considered.

Another difference is the default values of the event settings. When using `fireEvent` by default it assumes the event is bubbling (bubbles: true) and not preventable (cancelable: false).

- Fire event with default configuration

```ts
// Fires the event as NOT preventable and bubbling
this.fireEvent("change");
```

- Fire event with non-default configuration

The method allows configuring the `cancelable` and `bubbles` fields via function arguments - the third and fourth parameters respectively.

```ts
// Fires the event as preventable and non-bubbling
this.fireEvent("change", {}, true, false);
```

### noConflict mode

By default, UI5 Web Components fire all custom events twice: once with their name (e.g., `change`) and once more with a `ui5-` prefix (e.g., `ui5-change`). For example, when the `ui5-switch` is toggled, it fires a `change` event and a `ui5-change` event.

This `noConflict` setting allows us to prevent clashes between native and custom events.

The `noConflict` setting (`@ui5/webcomponents-base/config/NoConflict.js`) controls this behavior:
- **`false` (default)**: Events fire both with and without the `ui5-` prefix.
- **`true`**: Events fire only with the `ui5-` prefix, avoiding name collisions with third-party libraries.
- **Object**: Specific events listed in the object fire only with the `ui5-` prefix, while all other events fire both ways. Example:
  ```json
  {
      "events": ["selection-change", "header-click"]
  }
  ```
  In this case, only `selection-change` and `header-click` fire with the `ui5-` prefix, leaving these names available for other uses.

**Note:** With this setting, when attaching an event listener to a UI5 web component used inside a template, the event name must be specified with the ui5- prefix.
