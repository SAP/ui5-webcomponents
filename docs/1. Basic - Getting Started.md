# Getting started

*This section explains how to try out UI5 Web Components for the first time*

## Distribution model

UI5 Web Components are distributed as **ES6 modules** across several **NPM packages**:

The most commonly used ones are:
 - `@ui5/webcomponents` - components library, containing bread-and-butter components (buttons, inputs, pickers, etc...)
 - `@ui5/webcomponents-fiori` - components library, containing semantic, higher-order components
 - `@ui5/webcomponents-icons` - icons collection, containing general-purpose and business-oriented icons

*Important: There is no CDN for UI5 Web Components*. Each application is expected to **import** and **bundle** only the components (and any other resources) it is going to use.

### Bundling UI5 Web Components

To build your UI5 Web Components project tou can use any bundling tool that supports the following features:
 - `.json` imports
 - dynamic ES6 imports

This is true of all modern bundlers.  

Here are a couple of examples with the most commonly used tools:

#### 1. Parcel

 - Initialize the project:

    ```npm init```


 - Install `parcel` globally:
   
    ```npm i -g parcel-bundler```

   
 - Add `@ui5/webcomponents` as a dependency to your project:

   ```npm i @ui5/webcomponents```


 - Create an `index.html` file where the `ui5-button` component will be used:

    ```html
    <html>
        <body>
            <script src="./index.js"></script>
            <ui5-button>Click me!</ui5-button>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
 - Create an `index.js` file that will import the `ui5-button` component:

    ```js
    import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js";
    ```
 - Run the project

    ```parcel index.html```


 - Parcel will build your project and provide a link where you can see your `ui5-button` instance. 

#### 2. Vite

 - Create a new `vite` project with the `vanilla` template.
   

   *Note: the next command will create a new directory called `my-test-app`, so make sure you haven't created a directory for this project already:*
   

   ```npm init vite@latest my-test-app -- --template vanilla```
   
   
   ...and follow the instructions, output by vite:
   
   
   ```cd my-test-app```
   
   ```npm install```
   
   ```npm run dev```

This will create and build an empty project and provide a link to open it. 

 - Add `@ui5/webcomponents` as a dependency to your project:

  ```npm i @ui5/webcomponents```

 - Add `<ui5-button>Click me!</ui5-button>` inside the `index.html` file, for example after the opening `<body>` tag:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="favicon.svg" />
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
       <title>Vite App</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <ui5-button>Click me!</ui5-button>
   
       <div id="app"></div>
       <script type="module" src="/main.js"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```
   
 - Import the `ui5-button` component in `main.js` (for example at the top of the file):

   ```js
   import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js";
   ```
   
 - Observe the `ui5-button` component in your browser

#### 3. Webpack

- Initialize the project:

  ```npm init```


- Install `webpack` globally:

  ```npm i -g webpack-cli```


- Add `@ui5/webcomponents` as a dependency to your project:

  ```npm i @ui5/webcomponents```


- Create an `index.html` file where the `ui5-button` component will be used:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
       <body>
           <ui5-button>Click me!</ui5-button>
           <script src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
       </body>
   </html>
   ```
- Create an `index.js` file that will import the `ui5-button` component:

   ```js
   import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js";
   ```

 - Create a `webpack.config.js` file with the following configuration:

   ```js
   const path = require('path');
   
   module.exports = {
    entry: './index.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'bundle.js',
    },
   };
   ```
 - Run the command:

   ```webpack```

   to build the bundle in the `dist/` directory.


 - Finally, serve the project with any static server, such as `serve`:


   ```npm i -g serve```  (to install `serve` globally, if you don't have it)
   
   ```serve .```
