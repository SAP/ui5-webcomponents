# Releases

The article describes the release process management of UI5 Web Components.

## Release Strategy

The UI5 Web Components follow the well-known [NPM Semantic Versioning strategy](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning)
and produce the following type of releases:

- **Patch releases**

Includes backward compatible bug fixes and increments the third digit, e.g. 2.0.1.


- **Minor releases**

Includes backward compatible new features and increments the middle digit and resets the last digit to zero, e.g. 2.1.0, 2.2.0, 2.3.0, etc.


- **Major releases**

Includes changes that break backward compatibility and increments the first digit and resets the middle and last digits to zero, e.g. 2.0.0.
