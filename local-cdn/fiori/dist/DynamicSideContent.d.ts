/**
 * @class
 *
 * ### Overview
 *
 * The DynamicSideContent (`ui5-dynamic-side-content`) is a layout component that allows additional content
 * to be displayed in a way that flexibly adapts to different screen sizes. The side
 * content appears in a container next to or directly below the main content
 * (it doesn't overlay). When the side content is triggered, the main content becomes
 * narrower (if appearing side-by-side). The side content contains a separate scrollbar
 * when appearing next to the main content.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * *When to use?*
 *
 * Use this component if you want to display relevant information that is not critical
 * for users to complete a task. Users should have access to all the key functions and
 * critical information in the app even if they do not see the side content. This is
 * important because on smaller screen sizes it may be difficult to display the side
 * content in a way that is easily accessible for the user.
 *
 * *When not to use?*
 *
 * Don't use it if you want to display navigation or critical information that prevents
 * users from completing a task when they have no access to the side content.
 *
 * ### Responsive Behavior
 *
 * Screen width \> 1440px
 *
 * - Main vs. side content ratio is 75 vs. 25 percent (with a minimum of 320px
 * each).
 * - If the application defines a trigger, the side content can be hidden.
 *
 * Screen width \<\= 1440px and \> 1024px
 *
 * - Main vs. side content ratio is 66.666 vs. 33.333 percent (with a minimum of
 * 320px each). If the side content width falls below 320 px, it automatically slides
 * under the main content, unless the app development team specifies that it should
 * disappear.
 *
 * Screen width \<\= 1024px and \> 720px
 *
 * - The side content ratio is fixed to 340px, and the main content takes the rest
 * of the width. Only if the `sideContentFallDown` is set to `OnMinimumWidth`
 * and screen width is \<\= 960px and \> 720px the side content falls below the main content.
 *
 * Screen width \<\= 720px (for example on a mobile device)
 *
 * - In this case, the side content automatically disappears from the screen (unless
 * specified to stay under the content by setting of `sideContentVisibility`
 * property to `AlwaysShow`) and can be triggered from a pre-set trigger
 * (specified within the app). When the side content is triggered, it replaces the main
 * content. We recommend that you always place the trigger for the side content in the
 * same location, such as in the app footer.
 *
 * A special case allows switching the comparison mode between the main and side content.
 * In this case, the screen is split into 50:50 percent for main vs. side content. The
 * responsive behavior of the equal split is the same as in the standard view - the
 * side content disappears on screen widths of less than 720 px and can only be
 * viewed by triggering it.
