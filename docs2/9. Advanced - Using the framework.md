# Using the framework

Most of the time you'll be using the UI5 Web Components' APIs to do your job. However, there are also certain framework-level
APIs you should be aware of.

*This section explains what APIs the framework itself provides*

### 1. Configuration

All modules in `@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/` are public. You can use them in order to:
 - read the configured settings
 - change some settings during runtime (`theme`, `language`, etc...)

```js
import { getTheme, setTheme } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Theme.js";
import { getLanguage, setLanguage } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Language.js";
import { getAnimationMode, setAnimationMode } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/AnimationMode.js";
import { getCalendarType } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/CalendarType.js";
import { getNoConflict, setNoConflict } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/NoConflict.js";
import { getFirstDayOfWeek } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/FormatSettings.js";
import { getFetchDefaultLanguage, setFetchDefaultLanguage } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Language.js";
```

See the [Configuration](./8.%20Advanced%20-%20Configuration.md#imports) section

### 2. OpenUI5 Support

```js
import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/OpenUI5Support.js";
```

If your app uses both OpenUI5 and UI5 Web Components, UI5 Web Components can benefit
from OpenUI5 configuration and resources.

When you import the above module:
 - OpenUI5 configuration takes precedence over UI5 Web Components configuration
   for all common entities (theme, language, etc...). In addition, changing the theme
   in OpenUI5 will also change the theme in UI5 Web Components.
 - Fonts will not be loaded twice (just once by OpenUI5, and reused).
 - Locale data assets will not be fetched twice (just once by OpenUI5, and reused).

Therefore, if you intend to run both frameworks in the same browser window,
it is highly recommended to enable OpenUI5 support and benefit from these optimizations.

### 3. Scoping

```js
import {
	getCustomElementsScopingSuffix,
	setCustomElementsScopingSuffix,
	getCustomElementsScopingRules,
	setCustomElementsScopingRules,
} from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CustomElementsScope.js";
```

The `scoping` feature lets you add an arbitrary suffix to the names of some, or all, UI5 Web Components' custom elements tags:

Example:

```js
import { 
    getCustomElementsScopingSuffix, 
    setCustomElementsScopingSuffix,
    getCustomElementsScopingRules,
    setCustomElementsScopingRules,
} from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CustomElementsScope.js";

setCustomElementsScopingSuffix("demo");
setCustomElementsScopingRules({include: [/^ui5-/], exclude: [/^ui5-my-/, /-test-/]});

console.log(getCustomElementsScopingSuffix);
console.log(getCustomElementsScopingRules);
```

For more information on scoping and its use cases, see the dedicated [Scoping](./10.%20Advanced%20-%20Scoping.md) section.

### 4. Boot

```js
import { attachBoot } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/Boot.js";
```

The `attachBoot` function allows you to execute custom code when the framework has finished booting.

Example:

```js
attachBoot(() => {
	console.log("Framework booted");
});
```
