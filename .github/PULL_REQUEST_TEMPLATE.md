### PR checklist

For example: `fix(ui5-*): correct/fix sth` or `feat(ui5-*): add/introduce sth`. If you don't want the change to be part of the release changelog - use `chore`, `refactor` or `docs`.

- [ ] Add proper description about the background of the change and the change itself

- [ ] Link to an existing issue (if available)

Use `Fixes: {#PR_NUMBER}` to close the issue automatically when the PR is merged
or `Related to: {#PR_NUMBER}` to just create a link between the PR and the issue.

- [ ] Read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/UI5/webcomponents/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
