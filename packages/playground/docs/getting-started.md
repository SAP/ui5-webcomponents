# Getting Started

The UI5 Web Components share fundamental UI5 qualities with others to provide enterprise-grade features, Fiori UX and themeability. The goal is to achieve an easy consumption of UI5 controls to lower the entry barrier to use UI5 controls for own applications and to avoid complexity of the UI5 rendering-stack by making the consumption of the full-stack UI5 optional. In general, the UI5 Web Components target web developers who want to have more flexibility to use just HTML tags or arbitrary JS frameworks.
