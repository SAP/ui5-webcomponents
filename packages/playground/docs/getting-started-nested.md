# Getting Started

The UI5 Web Components carry fundamental UI5 qualities, along with others, to provide enterprise-grade features, Fiori UX, and themeability. The goal is to achieve easy consumption of UI5 controls and to lower the entry barrier to use UI5 controls for own applications. By making the consumption of the full-stack UI5 optional, UI5 Web Components allow you to avoid the complexity of the UI5 rendering stack. In general, the UI5 Web Components are targeting web developers who want to have more flexibility to use just HTML tags or arbitrary JS frameworks.
