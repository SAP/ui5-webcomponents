 * Sets the default icon collection for a given theme.

 * SAP Icons is the default icon collection (that resolves to SAP-icons version 5.x in Horizon theme family and SAP-icons version 4.x in all other themes)

 * This method allows setting another (built-in or custom) icon collection as default per theme.
 *
 * <b>Usage</b>
 * <b>For example</b>, to make "SAP-icons version 5.x" the default icon collection in "sap_fiori_3":
 *
 * <pre>
 * setDefaultIconCollection("sap_fiori_3", "SAP-icons-v5");
 *
 * <ui5-icon name="home"></ui5-icon>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>For example</b>, to make a custom icon collection (with name "my-custom-collection") the default icon collection in "sap_fiori_3":
 *
 * <pre>
 * setDefaultIconCollection("sap_fiori_3", "my-custom-collection");
 *
 * <ui5-icon name="custom-icon-name"></ui5-icon>
