# UI5 Web Components - SAP Business Suite Icons

[![npm Package Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ui5%2Fwebcomponents.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents)

Provides assets for the rich `business-suite` icon collection.

| Icon asset               | Module import                                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All icons (~73KB zipped) | `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite/dist/AllIcons.js";`        |
| 1x2 grid layout icon     | `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite/dist/1x2-grid-layout.js";` |
| 2x1 grid layout icon     | `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite/dist/2x1-grid-layout.js";` |
| ...                      | ...                                                                         |
| Year icon                | `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite/dist/year.js";`            |

*Note:* The `@ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite` package does not provide any web components per se, but rather icon assets,
usable by other web components such as `ui5-icon`. You could import all icons, but it's recommended to import
just the ones that your app will actually use.

## Usage

Since this is a non-default icon collection, all names have to be prefixed with the collection name and a `/` separator when used by web components.

Example usage with `<ui5-icon>` web component:

```html
<ui5-icon name="business-suite/1x2-grid-layout"></ui5-icon>
```
