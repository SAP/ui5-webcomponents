completion efficiency and making the experience intuitive and valuable for users.

## AI Writing Assistant for Input Fields

The AI Writing Assistant appears within input field components to help users create,
iterate, and improve text entries using Quick Prompts. Experts, known as prompt engineers,
craft these generative AI instructions with a focus on prompt quality.
The AI Writing Assistant Menu offers writing-specific prompts such as "Change Tone",
"Adjust Length", "Translate" and "Analyze Text." Users can apply these prompts to the
entire text or just a selected portion.
