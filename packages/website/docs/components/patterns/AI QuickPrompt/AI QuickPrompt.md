### Overview

Pre-made or "quick" prompts are predefined templates created by prompt engineers to make commonly used prompts easier and faster to use. These prompts help streamline repetitive tasks and reduce the need for writing the same instructions repeatedly.

This pattern simplifies the user experience by offering ready-to-use prompts, allowing users to skip writing boilerplate prompts.
