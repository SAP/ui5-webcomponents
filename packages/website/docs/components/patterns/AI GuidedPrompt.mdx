### Overview
Guided prompts provide structured input-UIs to guide the user in instructing the generative Al model on the desired output. They are helpful when users want to specify certain attributes, styles, or parameters for the generated content.

Guided prompts offer control and precision in generating output that aligns with user preferences. All provided information is combined into a processable prompt in the back-end and the user only needs to select the desired option instead of verbalizing them in a custom prompt.
