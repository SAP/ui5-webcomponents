## Horizontal cell alignment

Controls the horizontal alignment of cells by using the `horizontalAlign` property.

Please note that the behavior of `horizontalAlign` depends on where you set it:
- `horizontalAlign` is set on `TableHeaderCell` level<br />
Changes the horizontal alignment of the `TableHeaderCell` and its corresponding `TableCell`.
- `horizontalAlign` is set on `TableCell` level only<br />
The horizontal alignment is only changed for this one `TableCell`
- `horizontalAlign` is set on `TableHeaderCell` and `TableCell` level<br />
Changing the `horizontalAlign` property on `TableHeaderCell` level changes only the `TableHeaderCell` itself and those `TableCell` without a `horizontalAlign` property.
