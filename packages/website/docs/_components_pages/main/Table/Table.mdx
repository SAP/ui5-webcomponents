:::info
This Table web component is available since 2.0 and has been newly implemented to provide better screen reader and keyboard handling support.
Currently, it's considered experimental as its API is subject to change.
This Table replaces the previous Table web component, that has been part of **@ui5/webcomponents** version 1.x.
For compatibility reasons, we moved the previous Tabple implementation to the **@ui5/webcomponents-compat** package
and will be maintained until the new Table is experimental.
