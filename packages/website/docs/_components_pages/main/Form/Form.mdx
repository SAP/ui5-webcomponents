## More Samples

### Groups
You can define groups via the **ui5-form-group** web component.

<Groups />


### Layout
Use the Form#**layout** property to define the number of columns to distribute the form content by breakpoint.

- S1 M2 L3 XL5 - 1 cols in S, 2 cols in M, 3 cols in L and 5 cols in XL
- S1 M2 L4 XL6 -  1 cols in S, 2 cols in M, 4 cols in L and 6 cols in XL
- S2 M3 L5 XL7 - 2 cols in S, 3 cols in M, 5 cols in L and 7 cols in XL

<Layout />

### Edit
The Form has no built-in functionality to transform texts into inputs to implement editable forms. This is delegated to the consumers as shown in the sample.
**Note:** We recommend using "Large" item spacing in "display" mode, and "Normal" for "edit" mode, to avoid "jumping" effect of switching between texts and inputs.

<Edit />


### Label Span
Use the Form#**labelSpan** property to define the width proportion of the labels and fields of a FormItem by breakpoint.

- S12 M4 L4 XL4 - the label takes 1/3 in M, L, XL
- S12 M6 L6 XL6 - the label takes 1/2 in M, L, XL
- S12 M12 L12 XL12 - the label takes the whole line and the texts gows on the next line (in all sizes)

<LabelSpan />


### Column Span
Use the FormGroup#**columnSpan** property to define how many columns the group should expand to.
