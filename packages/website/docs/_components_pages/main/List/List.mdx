### Wrapping Behavior
The standard list item `<ui5-li>` supports text wrapping through the <b>wrappingType</b> property. When set to "Normal", long text content (title and description) will wrap to multiple lines instead of truncating with an ellipsis. For very long content, the text is displayed with a "Show More/Show Less" mechanism.

The wrapping behavior is responsive:
- On mobile devices (size S), text is truncated after 100 characters
- On tablets and desktop (size M and larger), text is truncated after 300 characters

This feature improves readability when displaying lengthy content in lists.

The `<ui5-li-custom>` is intentionally designed as a generic container to provide maximum flexibility. It can be used alongside `ui5-expandable-text` for long text content.
