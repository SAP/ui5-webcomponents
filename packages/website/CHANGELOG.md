### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ui5-list:** The `busy` property of the `ui5-list` is renamed.
If you have previously used the `busy`, `busyDelay` properties:
```html
<ui5-list busy busy-delay="500"></ui5-list>
```
now you must use  `loading` and `loadingDelay` properties:
```html
<ui5-list loading loading-delay="500"></ui5-list>
```
* **ui5-progress-indicator:** The `disabled` property of the `ui5-progress-indicator` is removed.
If you have previously used the `disabled` property, it won't take effect:
```html
<ui5-progress-indicator disabled value="60"></ui5-progress-indicator>
```

* **ui5-tabcontainer:** Property "fixed" is removed and there is no alternative provided. The TabContainer is no longer expandable/collapsible via use interaction. You can still show the TabContainer collapsed via the "collapsed" property.
* **ui5-upload-collection:** The `selectionMode` property no longer accepts "Delete" as value.
If you have previously used it:
```html
<ui5-upload-collection selection-mode="Delete"></ui5-upload-collection>
```
Now omit it completely and use `hide-delete-button` onto the ui5-upload-collection:

   <ui5-upload-collection-item hide-delete-button>  </ui5-upload-collection-item>
</ui5-upload-collection>
```

<ui5-list class="list" mode="MultiSelect">
<ui5-upload-collection mode="SingleSelectBegin">
<ui5-upload-collection mode="SingleSelectEnd">
<ui5-tree mode="SingleSelectAuto" >
<ui5-tree mode="None" >
```
Now use `selectionMode`  and `Single`, `Multiple` instead:
```html
<ui5-list class="list" selection-mode="Single">
<ui5-list class="list" selection-mode="Multiple">
<ui5-upload-collection selection-mode="SingleStart">
<ui5-upload-collection selection-mode="SingleEnd">

* Removed the `CSP.js` module and the creation of `<style>` and `<link>` tags, as all browsers now support adoptedStyleSheets. The following APIs are not available any more and should not be used:
```ts
import { setUseLinks } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CSP.js"
import { setPackageCSSRoot } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CSP.js"
import { setPreloadLinks } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CSP.js"

```
Use the CardHeader type instead:

    .cardHeader::part(status) { ... }
</style>
<ui5-card-header status="3 of 10"></ui5-popover>
```
Now use `additionalText` instead:
```html

       .cardHeader::part(additional-text) { ... }
</style>
<ui5-card-header class="cardHeader" additional-text="3 of 10"></ui5-card-header>

    static get render() {
        return litRenderer;
    }
}
```
start using "renderer"
```ts

    static get renderer() {
        return litRenderer;
    }
}
```
* Remove  JavaScript template option from @ui5/create-webcomponents-package
Previously `npm init @ui5/webcomponents-package` used to create JS-based project, however now it will be TypeScript-based project.
If you previously used `npm init @ui5/webcomponents-package --enable-typescript` to create  TypeScript-based project, now it's by default, e.g `npm init @ui5/webcomponents-package` and `--enable-typescript` is removed.

```html
<ui5-popover horizontal-align="Left" placement-type="Left"></ui5-popover>
```
Now use `Start` or `End` instead:
```html
<ui5-popover horizontal-align="Start" placement-type="Start"></ui5-popover>

```
```js
button.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
	colorPalettePopover.open = !colorPalettePopover.open;
