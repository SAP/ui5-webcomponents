## What's next
Anticipate the official 2.0 release between mid-June to mid-July, featuring: 🚀

### In-Progress Features

-   **Form Support with Form-Associated Custom Elements**: Streamline form handling with support for the Form-Associated Custom Elements standard.

### In-Progress Breaking changes

-  **Theming**: Removal of Belize (recommendation: migrate to Horizon)
-  **Rename of properties, events and enumarion values**

-  **Several APIs will be replaced with more effective alternatives:**:

	-   Replace all public methods for opening popover, such as `openPicker`, `togglePicker` with `open` property to promote declarative APIs
	-   Grouping of Items: Instead of using `ui5-li-groupheader` as separator in a flat structure, the API will support true nesting of ListItems inside ListItemGroup, to easier bind hierarchical data model to the UI.
	-   Menu: property `starts-section` replaced by `ui5-menu-separator` component.
	-   List: property `imag`e, replaced by slot `image`.
	-   TabContainer: `show-overflow` property, replaced by slot `overflowButton`.
	-   IllustratedMessage: property `titleLevel`, replaced by slot `title` (that you can set the level on).


:::warning[**This properties will be removed without alternative**:]

-   Progress Indicator (ui5-progress-indicator): Remove `disabled` property 
-   Selects's Option (ui5-option): Remove `disabled` property - UX and ACC standards suggest to not include any disabled items in the dropdown
-   Token (ui5-token): Remove the `readonly` property
