## 2.0 Breaking changes

- 90% is pure API renaming for better consistency 
- several APIs are replaced by alternatives (listed below)
- few APIs are removed without alternatives (listed below)


### Theming
- Removal of Belize (recommendation: migrate to Horizon)

### Framework
-  CSP (Content Security Policy) will be ensured via [adoptedStyleSheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/adoptedStyleSheets) only.
The adoptedStyleSheets are CSP compliant by design and all components styles will be defined as adoptedStyleSheets.

The `CSP.js` module is removed and the creation of `<style>` and `<link>` tags is no longer required as all browsers now support adoptedStyleSheets.

As a result, hte following APIs are not available any more and should not be used:
```ts
import { setUseLinks } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CSP.js"
import { setPackageCSSRoot } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CSP.js"
import { setPreloadLinks } from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CSP.js"
```

### Renamed APIs
See the full list [here](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/issues/8461).

### Replaced APIs

- Methods `openPicker` will be replaced by `open/opener` properties to promote declarative API

- **Grouping of Items**

Instead of using `ui5-li-groupheader` as separator in a flat structure:

```html
<ui5-list>
	<ui5-li-groupheader>group<ui5-li-groupheader/>
	<ui5-li></ui5-li>
	<ui5-li></ui5-li>
	<ui5-li></ui5-li>
</ui5-list>
```

true nesting will be provided of ListItems inside ListItemGroup 
to easier bind hierarchical data model to the UI:

```html
<ui5-list>
	<ui5-li-group header-text="group">
		<ui5-li></ui5-li>
		<ui5-li></ui5-li>
		<ui5-li></ui5-li>
	<ui5-li-group>
</ui5-list>
```


- **Menu**: the property `starts-section` will be replaced by `ui5-menu-separator` component.
- **List**: the property `image` will be replaced by slot `image`
- **TabContainer:** the property `show-overflow` property is will be replaced by slot `overflowButton`.
- **IllustratedMessage:** the property `titleLevel` will be replaced by slot `title`.


### Removed APIs without alternative

#### Progress Indicator (ui5-progress-indicator)
- The `disabled` property will be removed. Progress indicator isn't an interactive element so disabled property make no sense. 
Also aria-disabled is deprecated on the progressbar role since ARIA 1.2 .


#### Selects's Option (ui5-option)
- The `disabled` property will be removed. The UX and ACC standards suggest to not include any disabled items in the dropdown


#### Token (ui5-token)
- The `readonly` property will be removed.
