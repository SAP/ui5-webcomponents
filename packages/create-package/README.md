# UI5 Web Components - Create Package

[![npm Package Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ui5%2Fwebcomponents.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents)

Provides an `npm init` script for creating new "UI5 Web Components" packages.

## Usage with npm

```
Usage:

# npm 6.x
    npm init @ui5/webcomponents-package [OPTIONS]
# npm 7+, an extra double-dash is needed:
    npm init @ui5/webcomponents-package -- [OPTIONS]

Options:
    --name <string>     - defines the package name
    --component-name <string>      - defines the component class name that will be created in your new package
    --tag <string>      - defines the tag name of the sample web component that will be created in your new package. The tag will be derived from the component name if not provided.
    --enable-typescript - enables TypeScript support for the package
    --skip              - skips configuration and generates package with a default value for each parameter that wasn't passed
```

The script creates a new directory, and fills it with a `package.json` file and all necessary source files, and resources for a new
components package.
