[![npm Package Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ui5%2Fwebcomponents.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents)

Provides assets for the rich `SAP-icons` icon collection.

|      Icon asset       |                           Module import                        |
| ------------------------ |  ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| All icons (~115KB zipped)       |  `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/Assets.js";`      |
| Accelerated icon           |  `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/accelerated.js";`  |
| Accept icon           |  `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/accept.js";`  |
| ...           |  ...  |
| Zoom out icon           |  `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/zoom-out.js";`  |

*Note:* The `@ui5/webcomponents-icons` package does not provide any web components per se, but rather icon assets,
usable by other web components such as `ui5-icon`. You could import all icons, but it's recommended to import 
just the ones that your app will actually use.
