    "content": "Get Started with UI5 Web Components &amp; React In this tutorial, you will learn how to add UI5 Web Components to your application. You can add UI5 Web Components both to new React applications and to already existing ones. Important: The get the best development experience, we recommend using the UI5 Web Components for React and follow the UI5 Web Components for React Тutorial. UI5 Web Components for React library is a React implementation of UI5 Web Components which overcomes several limitations of React in handling web components in general, explained in the “Additional Info” section below. Here are the steps to use pure UI5 Web Components in React: Step 1. Create a new application. For example, with create-react-app. npx create-react-app ui5-web-components-application cd ui5-web-components-application Step 2. Add UI5 Web Components. npm install @ui5/webcomponents --save Step 3. Import the components that you are going to use. import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js&quot;; Step 4. Use the imported elements in your application. &lt;ui5-button&gt;Hello world!&lt;/ui5-button&gt; Step 5. Launch the application. yarn start Additional Info When developing with React, there are two slight React limitations you should know about. These are not related to UI5 Web Components per se, but with using custom elements in React in general. Event Binding In order to use the events provided by UI5 Web Components, currently you need to get a ref to the component because React doesn’t support custom events. Here is an example of what you need to do in order to use the events provided by UI5 Web Components: class Home extends Component { constructor (props) { super(props); this.switch = React.createRef(); } componentDidMount() { this.switch.addEventListener(&#39;change&#39;, event =&gt; { console.log(&#39;switch is toggled&#39;); }) } render(){ return( &lt;ui5-switch ref={this.switch}&gt;&lt;/ui5-switch&gt; ); } } Boolean Properties Binding For boolean properties like collapsed in ui5-panel, instead of setting true or false, you have to take care of the presence of the property. Here is an example: &lt;ui5-panel header-text=&quot;Achievements&quot; collapsed={!this.state.achievements.length || undefined}&gt; &lt;!-- Content of ui5-panel --&gt; &lt;/ui5-panel&gt; UI5 Web Components for React As mentioned above, for a better development experience (and to elegantly work around these 2 React limitations), check out UI5 Web Components for React, UI5 Web Components for React and this tutorial.",

    "title": "Configuration",
    "content": "Configuration This section explains how you can configure UI5 Web Components globally, and what configuration settings are available. Configuration Settings There are several configuration settings that affect all UI5 Web Components globally. Setting Values Default Value Description Applies To theme sap_fiori_3, sap_fiori_3_dark, sap_fiori_3_hcb, sap_fiori_3_hcw, sap_belize, sap_belize_hcb, sap_belize_hcw, sap_horizon sap_fiori_3 Visual theme to be applied All components language ar, bg, ca, cs, cy, da, de, el, en, en_GB, es, es_MX, et, fi, fr, fr_CA, hi, hr, hu, in, it, iw, ja, kk, ko, lt, lv, ms, nl, no, pl, pt_PT, pt, ro, ru, sh, sk, sl, sv, th, tr, uk, vi, zh_CN, zh_TW N/A (null) Language to be used for translatable texts Components and icons with translatable texts animationMode full, basic, minimal, none full Amount/intensity of animations to be played for some components Components with animations (ui5-panel, ui5-carousel, etc.) calendarType Gregorian, Islamic, Buddhist, Japanese, Persian Gregorian Default calendar type to be used for date-related components Date/time components (ui5-date-picker, etc.) noConflict true, false false When set to true, all events will be fired with a ui5- prefix only Components that fire events (most do) formatSettings See the Format settings section below {} Allows to override locale-specific configuration Date/time components (ui5-date-picker, etc.) fetchDefaultLanguage true, false false Whether to fetch assets even for the default language Framework theme The theme setting values above are the technical names of the supported themes: The sap_horizon is known as Horizon and it’s the latest theme currently available as a preview version The sap_fiori_3 is known as Quartz Light and it`s the default theme. The sap_fiori_3_dark is known as Quartz Dark. The sap_fiori_3_hcb is known as Quartz High Contrast Black. The sap_fiori_3_hcw is known as Quartz High Contrast White. The sap_belize is known as Belize. The sap_belize_hcb is known as High Contrast Black. The sap_belize_hcw is known as High Contrast White. The default theme (sap_fiori_3) is built in all UI5 Web Components. Thus, components are always themed. Configuring another theme will additionally fetch and use that theme. Any theme is fetched just once. To use additional themes (other than sap_fiori_3): Import the Assets.js module of each component library you’re using, for example: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Assets.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/Assets.js&quot;; For more about assets, see the dedicated Assets section. Configure the additional theme either via the configuration script or module imports. Example: import { setTheme } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Theme.js&quot;; setTheme(&quot;sap_belize_hcb&quot;); language The language configuration setting does not have a default value (the default value is technically null). This is how the language to use is determined: If a language is configured, it will be used. If no language is configured (the setting is null), the user’s browser language is checked, and if in the supported list, used. If the user’s browser language is not in the supported list, but is a variation of a supported language, this language will be used (e.g. fr_** -&gt; fr ) The en language will be used. The en language is built in all UI5 Web Components that have translatable texts. Thus, components are always translated. Configuring another language will additionally fetch and use that language. Any language is fetched once. To use additional languages (other than en): Import the Assets.js module of each component/icon library you’re using (in general, each library that provides languages assets), for example: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Assets.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/Assets.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/Assets.js&quot;; For more about assets, see the dedicated Assets section. Configure the additional language either via the configuration script or module imports. Example: import { setLanguage } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Language.js&quot;; setLanguage(&quot;fr&quot;); animationMode This setting only applies to components that run animations. Animation modes allow to specify different animation scenarios or levels. When full, all animations run unrestricted. When basic, more light-weight set of animations would run. When minimal, animations of fundamental functionalities are included. When none, all animations are completely suspended. Note: Please, note that each component determines which animations would run for a specific mode. calendarType This setting determines the default calendar type for all date-related components such as ui5-date-picker, ui5-datetime-picker, etc. You can always override the calendar type for each instance via component-specific properties. See the documentation of each component for details. The Gregorian calendar type is built in all date-related UI5 Web Components. Calendar types are opt-in features, see Using Features for details. Setting another calendar type via configuration or component properties requires that the respective calendar type be explicitly imported. Example: Make sure you’ve bundled the required calendar type: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Islamic.js&quot;; Configure this calendar: &lt;script data-ui5-config type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt; { &quot;calendarType&quot;: &quot;Islamic&quot; } &lt;/script&gt; Now all date-related components will use the Islamic calendar type by default. noConflict By default, UI5 Web Components fire all custom events twice - once with the documented name (e.g. change), and once more with a ui5- prefix (e.g. ui5-change). For example, when the ui5-switch is toggled, it fires a change event, but also a ui5-change event. The noConflict configuration setting allows certain control over this behavior: When false (default value), all custom events are fired with and without the ui5- prefix. When true, all custom events are fired with the ui5- prefix only. Hence the noConflict semantic in the name of the setting. This is handy, for example, if the name of an event, fired by a component, happens to collide with the name of an event provided by a third-party library. When an object is supplied, just the specified events will be fired with the ui5- prefix only. All other events will be fired normally - once with the prefix, and once without it. The format of this object is as follows: { &quot;events&quot;: [&quot;selection-change&quot;, &quot;header-click&quot;] } Note: Please, note that other keys may be added to this object in the future for the purpose of name conflict resolution. In the above example, only the selection-change and header-click events will be fired with a prefix. You can still use them by listening to ui5-selection-change and ui5-header-click, but the names selection-change and header-click will be free for use by other UI components and libraries without name collision. formatSettings This setting allows to override locale-specific settings for date-related controls. For example, to force the first day of week to Sunday, no matter the locale: { &quot;formatSettings&quot;: { &quot;firstDayOfWeek&quot;: 0 } } Setting Values Default Value Description firstDayOfWeek 0 (Sunday) through 6 (Saturday) Depends on locale When set, overrides the locale’s default value Note: Currently, only firstDayOfWeek is supported. More settings may be added in the future. fetchDefaultLanguage As described in the language configuration option section, the en language is built in all components that have translatable texts. All other languages are fetched as additional assets. Normally, you would never want to change that setting, but if for technical reasons you prefer even the default language to be fetched over the network, although it’s built-in, then set fetchDefaultLanguage this to true Example: &lt;script data-ui5-config type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt; { &quot;fetchDefaultLanguage&quot;: true } &lt;/script&gt; Configuration Script In order to provide configuration settings, include a &lt;script&gt; element in your HTML page with: data-ui5-config attribute type=&quot;application/json&quot; attribute Provide the desired configuration settings in a JSON object, as shown in the example below. Example: &lt;script data-ui5-config type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt; { &quot;theme&quot;: &quot;sap_belize_hcb&quot;, &quot;language&quot;: &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;animationMode&quot;: &quot;none&quot;, &quot;calendarType&quot;: &quot;Japanese&quot;, &quot;formatSettings&quot;: { &quot;firstDayOfWeek&quot;: 0 }, &quot;noConflict&quot;: { &quot;events&quot;: [&quot;selection-change&quot;, &quot;header-click&quot;] }, &quot;fetchDefaultLanguage&quot;: true } &lt;/script&gt; Configuration Module Imports The configuration script is used to set the initial configuration in a declarative manner. However, reading/modifying the configuration reliably can only be done programmatically. To do so, please import the desired functionality from the respective &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/&quot; module. theme import { getTheme, setTheme } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Theme.js&quot;; language import { getLanguage, setLanguage } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Language.js&quot;; animationMode import { getAnimationMode, setAnimationMode } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/AnimationMode.js&quot;; calendarType - can only be set initially in the configuration script. import { getCalendarType } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/CalendarType.js&quot;; noConflict import { getNoConflict, setNoConflict } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/NoConflict.js&quot;; formatSettings - can only be set initially in the configuration script. import { getFirstDayOfWeek } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/FormatSettings.js&quot;; fetchDefaultLanguage import { getFetchDefaultLanguage, setFetchDefaultLanguage } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Language.js&quot;; Next: Right-To-Left (RTL) And Compact Mode",

    "title": "Custom UI5 Web Components Packages",
    "content": "Creating a Custom UI5 Web Components Package This tutorial explains how to: Create an NPM package for your own UI5 Web Components. Use UI5 Web Components’ standard build tools: @ui5/webcomponents-tools. Gain all @ui5/webcomponents capabilities such as HBS template support, i18n, theming, test setup, etc. Note: Whether you use npm or yarn is a matter of preference. Step 1. Create an NPM package. Run the init command. Note: The following command will create a new directory and initialize your package there. Make sure you haven’t created a directory yourself. With npm: npm init @ui5/webcomponents-package or npm init @ui5/webcomponents-package &lt;NEW-PACKAGE-NAME&gt; With yarn: yarn create @ui5/webcomponents-package or yarn create @ui5/webcomponents-package &lt;NEW-PACKAGE-NAME&gt; where &lt;NEW-PACKAGE-NAME&gt; is the name of your new package (and the name of the directory to be created), for example: npm init @ui5/webcomponents-package my-components will create a my-components directory and initialize the package there. Follow the prompts. The initialization script will ask you to choose: The name of your package (if you did not already pass a name when running the command above); The port for your dev server (8080 by default - just press Enter to select this); The tag of the sample web component that will be created (my-first-component by default - just press Enter to select this). Your package is ready! Just follow the instructions: cd &lt;NEW-PACKAGE-NAME&gt; npm i (or yarn if you prefer) npm start (or yarn start if you prefer) Step 2. Run the dev server and test the build. To run the dev server, as instructed above: npm run start or yarn start and once the project is built for the first time, the browser will automatically open the dev server URL. You can also run the tests: npm run test or yarn test and the production build: npm run build or yarn build. Note: In order to run the tests for the first time, you must have built the project with either start or build. That’s it! Understanding the Project Structure package.json The initialization script will add several packages as dependencies. These three @ui5/ packages will serve as the foundation of your own package and Web Components. Package Type of Dependency Description @ui5/webcomponents-base dependency Base classes and framework @ui5/webcomponents-theming dependency Base theming assets @ui5/webcomponents-tools devDependency Build tools and configuration assets The initialization script will create several NPM scripts for you in package.json. Task Purpose clean Delete the dist/ directory with the build output. build Production build to the dist/ directory. lint Run a static code scan with eslint. start Build the project for development, run the dev server and watch for changes. watch Watch for changes only. serve Run the dev server only. test Run the dev server and execute the specs from the test/specs/ directory. create-ui5-element Create an empty Web Component with the given name. Files in the main directory The initialization script will create several files in your package’s main directory. File Purpose .eslintignore Excludes the dist/ and test/ directories from static code scans. package-scripts.js An nps package scripts configuration file. bundle.js Entry point for the bundle used for development and tests. You’ll likely only need to change bundle.js to import your new components there. The config/ directory The config/ directory serves as a central place for most build and test tools configuration assets. Normally, you don’t need to change any files there. Custom configuration The files in the config/ directory simply import UI5 Web Components default configuration for all tasks: rollup, wdio, eslint, etc. If you need to customize any configuration, simply put your own content into the respective file in config/. Examples: Modifying eslint settings. Open config/.eslintrc.js. It should look like this: module.exports = require(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-tools/components-package/eslint.js&quot;); As you can see, this is just a proxy to UI5 Web Components default configuration. Put your own content instead: module.exports = { &quot;env&quot;: { &quot;browser&quot;: true, &quot;es6&quot;: true }, &quot;root&quot;: true, &quot;extends&quot;: &quot;airbnb-base&quot;, ............. } Modifying wdio settings. Open config/wdio.conf.js. It should look like this: module.exports = require(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-tools/components-package/wdio.js&quot;); Again, this is a proxy to UI5 Web Components default configuration. You could just paste the content of @ui5/webcomponents-tools/components-package/wdio.js here and modify at will. However, let’s not replace the whole file by hand this time, but just modify the exported configuration object. const result = require(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-tools/components-package/wdio.js&quot;); result.config.capabilities[0][&quot;goog:chromeOptions&quot;].args = [&#39;--disable-gpu&#39;]; // From: [&#39;--disable-gpu&#39;, &#39;--headless&#39;] module.exports = result; In this example, what we did was simply replace one option in the configuration object to disable headless mode so that we can use browser.debug() in our *.spec.js files. For more on testing, see Testing Web Components. The src/ directory This is where you’ll do most of the development. Let’s see the necessary files for a my-first-component component. Class and template files The main files describing a Web Component are: File Purpose src/MyFirstComponent.js Web Component class src/MyFirstComponent.hbs Handlebars template In order to understand how a UI5 Web Component works and what lies behind these two files, make sure you check the Developing Web Components section of the documentation. For the purposes of this tutorial, however, you don’t need to understand their internals, as they are automatically generated by the script and are in a working state already. Theming-related files A single set of CSS rules will be used for all themes. The only difference between themes may be the values of CSS Variables. Some CSS Vars, such as --sapBackgroundColor and --sapTextColor are standard and automatically managed by the framework. In addition, you can define your own CSS Vars and provide different values for them for the different themes. Set these CSS Vars in the parameters-bundle.css file for each theme. These files are the entry points for the styles build script. File Purpose src/themes/MyFirstComponent.css All CSS rules for the Web Component, same for all themes; will be inserted in the shadow root. src/themes/sap_belize/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_belize theme src/themes/sap_belize_hcb/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_belize_hcb theme src/themes/sap_belize_hcw/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_belize_hcw theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3 theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3_dark/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_dark theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3_hcb/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_hcb theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3_hcw/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_hcw theme Note: It’s up to you whether to put the CSS Vars directly in the parameters-bundle.css files for the different themes or to import them from separate .css files. You could have, for example, a MyFirstComponent-params.css file for each theme and import it into the parameters-bundle.css file: @import &quot;MyFirstComponent-params.css&quot;;. Again, to know more about how these files work, you could have a look at the Developing Web Components section of the documentation. i18n files You can define translatable texts as key-value pairs, separated by = in the messagebundle.properties file. Then you can provide translations for as many languages as needed. File Purpose src/i18n/messagebundle.properties Source file for all translatable texts src/i18n/messagebundle_de.properties Translations in German src/i18n/messagebundle_en.properties Translations in English etc. etc. Let’s have a look at the sample messagebundle.properties file, generated by the script. #please wait text for the sample component PLEASE_WAIT=wait Here’s where you define all i18n texts, optionally with comments for the translators (# Comment). And now let’s have a look at a sample file with translations, for example messagebundle_es.properties: PLEASE_WAIT=Espere Assets (additional themes, i18n texts, etc.) File Purpose src/Assets.js Entry point for your package assets. This module imports all base assets (such as CLDR and the base theme parameters), but also your own package assets (i18n and package-specific theme parameters). Users of your package will have to import this module in their production applications in order to get additional themes support and i18n support. Note: For easier development and testing, Assets.js is also imported in the dev/test bundle bundle.esm.js by the initialization script. The test/ directory File Purpose test/pages/* Simple .html pages used for development and tests. src/specs/* Test specs, based on WDIO. They use the test pages for setup. You can execute all specs by running yarn test or npm run test. For more on testing, see our Testing Web Components section. Public Consumption of Your Custom UI5 Web Components Package Once you’ve developed your package and published it to NPM, application developers can import from the dist/ directory of your package any of your Web Components, and optionally the Assets.js module, if they want additional themes and i18n. For example, if your package is called my-ui5-webcomponents, users will install it by: npm i my-ui5-webcomponents --save and then use it by: import &quot;my-ui5-webcomponents/Assets.js&quot;; // optional import &quot;my-ui5-webcomponents/dist/MyFirstComponent.js&quot;; // for my-first-component from this tutorial import &quot;my-ui5-webcomponents/dist/SomeOtherComponent.js&quot;; import &quot;my-ui5-webcomponents/dist/YetAnotherComponent.js&quot;; Next: Developing Custom UI5 Web Components",

    "content": "General Development Workflow This document aims to explain the steps component developers would have to perform on daily basis from forking the project to merging a change, emphasising on the Github workflow. 1. Fork the UI5 Web Components repository. See how to fork a repo here. 2. Clone the UI5 Web Components repository. See how to clone a repo here. 3. Run the project. 3.0. Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed: Yarn; Node.js (version 14 or higher). 3.1. Install all dependencies. yarn 3.2. Build and serve the project. yarn start Once the project is served, you can explore the components in the browser that will automaticall open the dev server URL, usually: http://localhost:8080/ The server will reload the pages whenever you make changes in the code. 4. Develop. 4.1. Read the dedicated tutorials for component developers: Development Conventions and Guidelines; Developing Custom UI5 Web Components; Testing UI5 Web Components; Understanding UI5 Web Components Metadata. 4.2. Create a local branch within your fork and work with it as usual. 4.3. Before committing, run the linter to check if your code is written according to the project eslint configuration. $ yarn lint 4.4. Before committing, run the test of the component you are working on (see the article for testing above) to catch issues as soon as possible. $ cd packages/main $ yarn test test/specs/Button.spec.js 5. Open pull request (PR) from fork. You can open a pull request to the upstream repository from any branch or commit in your fork. We recommend that you make changes in a topic branch (not in your local main branch), so that you can push followup commits if you receive feedback on your pull request. You can open a pull request from the Github UI. 5.1. Find the “Pull requests” tab and then press the “New pull request” button. 5.2. Compare the main branch of the upstream with a branch from your fork. Note: The full guide on how to open PR from fork can be found here. 5.3. Once the PR is created you would have to accept a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). Just follow the link posted in the PR by the CLA assistant. Note: This is required only for your first PR. 5.4. Immediately after the PR is created, a central build process starts to verify the change, building the project and running all tests. In case you are interested in the build output, you can follow the link at the bottom of the PR page. 5.5. Wait for our code review and approval. After the PR is approved, the UI5 Web Components team will merge the change into the main branch. 6. Update pull request, created from a fork. You often would need to update your pull request, especially when you need to address review comments. To update your pull request, you have to push commits to the branch, that the pull request is based on and the changes will be reflected in the pull request. Note: We recommend syncing your fork before pushing commits to resolve merge conflicts beforehand. Note: The full guide on how to update PR can be found here. 7. Sync the fork. With the time your fork will be out of sync with the original repository and you would need to update it. 7.1. Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork. $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents.git 7.2. Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to main will be stored in a local branch, upstream/main. $ git fetch upstream 7.3. Check out your fork’s local main branch. $ git checkout main 7.4. Merge the changes from upstream/main into your local main branch. This brings your fork’s main branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes. $ git merge upstream/main Note: The full guide on how to sync a fork can be found here.",

    "title": "First steps",
    "content": "First Steps This section explains how to get started with UI5 Web Components. Distribution Model UI5 Web Components are distributed as ES6 modules across several NPM packages: The most commonly used ones are: @ui5/webcomponents - components library, containing bread-and-butter components (buttons, inputs, pickers, etc.); @ui5/webcomponents-fiori - components library, containing semantic, higher-order components; @ui5/webcomponents-icons - icons collection, containing general-purpose and business-oriented icons. Important: There is no CDN for UI5 Web Components. Each application is expected to import and bundle only the components (and any other resources) it is going to use. Bundling UI5 Web Components To build your UI5 Web Components project you can use any bundling tool that supports the following features: .json imports; dynamic ES6 imports. This is true of all modern bundlers. UI5 Web Components are shipped as ES6 modules and published on NPM. If you are already using a framework that handles bundling of ES6 modules, skip forward to Installation or check the Tutorials section. Creating a Project You can use any ES6 module-capable front-end tooling, but in case you don’t have a preference yet, you can start a new project using Vite. The only prerequisite is to have Node.js installed. npm init vite Select a project name: my-webcomponents-app Select a framework: vanilla Select a variant: JavaScript This command will create a project structure under my-webcomponents-app. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the initial depenednecies and start a dev server. cd my-webcomponents-app npm install npm run dev​ You should see a message that a server is running on Local: http://localhost:3000/. Launch your favourite IDE and change some code, the browser page will be automatically refreshed. Installation Install @ui5/webcomponents npm install @ui5/webcomponents This command downloads the published source code of the UI5 Web Components to the node_modules folder. Now, you can add them to your code to get them on the web page. Documentation Take a look at the available UI5 Web Components documentation in the playground. Usage 1. Import the needed Web Component. // src/main.js import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js&quot;; This line runs the code that registers the &lt;ui5-button&gt; tag with the browser. Now, when the browser sees such a tag, it knows how to render it. 2. Instantiate the Web Component. Next, change the application markup in the same file to display the button on the page: // src/main.js ... document.querySelector(&#39;#app&#39;).innerHTML = ` &lt;ui5-button&gt;Hello UI5 Web Components&lt;/ui5-button&gt; ` Check the browser to see the displayed button. You can now use UI5 Web Components just like normal HTML elements - set attributes on them, attach events, and more as described in the documentation. 3. Run a production build. If you want to deploy your project on a static hosting or in a Node.js project, run: npm run build The output will show what files were created along with their sizes: vite v2.3.4 building for production... ✓ 99 modules transformed. dist/assets/favicon.17e50649.svg 1.49kb dist/index.html 0.51kb dist/assets/index.ccce2ca3.css 0.16kb / brotli: 0.10kb dist/assets/index.4116dceb.js 0.12kb / brotli: 0.09kb dist/assets/vendor.c05c7785.js 114.92kb / brotli: 24.30kb The contents of the dist folder is ready to be deployed for productive usage.

We are currently working on a new tool, that will be publicly available. Follow this simple tutorial to build a custom theme running with UI5 Web Components in 5 minutes: Open UI Theme Designer. Go to the official docs and set up the Theme Designer. Create your custom theme in UI Theme Designer. Click the Create a New Theme button. Choose which SAP stock theme will serve as the base of your custom theme and click the Create Theme button in the footer of the dialog. Proceed to change as many parameters as you wish. Once you are done customizing, choose Theme -&gt; Export from the main menu on top. A dialog will appear, asking for Theme ID (technical name of your new theme) and a title. The Theme ID you choose at this point will be the one you’ll use in order to switch to your custom theme, for example if you choose mytheme: index.html?sap-ui-theme=mytheme Important: Before clicking the Export button, thus dismissing the dialog and finishing theme creation, it is mandatory that you expand the Optional Settings (for Experts) panel, and select the Source Files + CSS Resources option. Otherwise, no CSS Variables will be generated. Download the custom theme .zip file: Your browser will then download a .zip file with the name of your new theme, e.g. mytheme.zip. Copy the css_variables.css file with all CSS Variables for your custom theme to your project. You can find this file inside the .zip in the Base baseLib &lt;your theme name&gt; directory. For example: mytheme.zip Base baseLib mytheme css_variables.css. Just copy this file to a directory in your project where it can be statically served. Include the file in your project .html page: The simplest option would be to use a &lt;link&gt; tag and point to where you copied the file: &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;&lt;path-to-your-css-file&gt;/css_variables.css&quot;&gt; but you could as well use a &lt;style&gt; tag and paste the content of css_variables.css inside, if that’s what you prefer: &lt;style&gt; /* Here goes the content of css_variables.css */ &lt;/style&gt; And that’s it! Now you can use your custom theme by setting it either in the URL of your page, or in your configuration script: index.html?sap-ui-theme=mytheme or &lt;script data-ui5-config type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt; { &quot;theme&quot;: &quot;mytheme&quot; } &lt;/script&gt; Note: Using a custom theme does not prevent you from using the official themes. You can freely switch to and from them. import { setTheme } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Theme.js&quot;; setTheme(&quot;sap_fiori_3&quot;); ... setTheme(&quot;mytheme&quot;); ... setTheme(&quot;sap_fiori_3_dark&quot;); For more on configuring themes, see Configuration.

    "content": "Get Started with UI5 Web Components &amp; Angular In this tutorial, you will learn how to add UI5 Web Components to your application. The UI5 Web Components can be added both to new Angular applications and to already existing ones. Step 1. Install Angular CLI. npm install -g @angular/cli Step 2. Create a new Angular application. ng new ui5-web-components-application cd ui5-web-components-application Step 3. Add UI5 Web Components. npm install @ui5/webcomponents --save Step 4. Allow the use of custom elements in Angular. Before using UI5 Web Components, you have to allow the use of custom elements in Angular. To do so, import CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA in app.module.ts : import { ..., CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;; After importing it, add it to the schemas array: imports: [ ... ], schemas: [ CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA ] Step 5. Import the components you are going to use. import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js&quot;; Step 6. Use the imported elements in your application. &lt;ui5-button&gt;Hello world!&lt;/ui5-button&gt; Step 7. Launch the application. ng serve -o Additional Info Two-Way Data Binding You can use two-way data binding with the following components: CheckBox, RadioButton, Input, DatePicker, Switch, TextArea. In order to use it, you have to use a library called Origami that provides advanced support for two-way data binding of custom elements. Example: 1. Install Origami. npm install @codebakery/origami 2. Import the OrigamiFormsModule from Origami. import { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;; import { BrowserModule } from &#39;@angular/platform-browser&#39;; import { OrigamiFormsModule } from &#39;@codebakery/origami/forms&#39;; import { AppComponent } from &#39;./app.component&#39;; @NgModule({ imports: [BrowserModule, OrigamiFormsModule], declarations: [AppComponent], schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule {} 3. Use Origami in your template. &lt;ui5-input [(ngModel)]=&quot;value&quot; origami&gt;&lt;/ui5-input&gt; 4. Make Angular boot after UI5 Web Components are defined. Add the APP_INITIALIZER provider to the module where you are using UI5 Web Components. In order to do so, import APP_INITIALIZER and add it to the providers array like this (in this example we will add it to the app.module.ts): import { ..., APP_INITIALIZER } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;; import CheckBox from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/CheckBox&quot;; function onAppInit(): () =&gt; Promise&lt;any&gt; { return (): Promise&lt;any&gt; =&gt; { return CheckBox.define(); }; } @NgModule({ declarations: [ ... ], imports: [ ... ], providers: [ { provide: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: onAppInit, multi: true }, ], schemas: [ CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA ], bootstrap: [AppComponent] })",

    "title": "RTL and compact mode",
    "content": "Right-To-Left (RTL) and Compact Mode This section explains how to make UI5 Web Components render in RTL and compact mode. Note: Both of these settings are not properties of the components per se, but rather markers you set on some part of the HTML page that affect all components inside. RTL Support Some UI5 Web Components are RTL-aware, meaning they render differently when placed in an RTL-designated part of the DOM tree. Setting RTL To have the components render in RTL mode, just set the HTML attribute dir to rtl on the component itself, the body, html or any other relevant region of your application. Example 1: &lt;body dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt; (RTL will be set for all UI5 Web Components on the page.) Example 2: &lt;body&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Button 1&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;div dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Button 2&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ui5-button dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;Button 3&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;/body&gt; (RTL will be set for Button 2 and Button 3.) Changing RTL Dynamically The first time UI5 Web Components are rendered, they will take into account the dir attribute of the respective part of the DOM tree they are placed in. However, if you change dir dynamically afterwards, you must call the applyDirection method to re-render all RTL-aware components. Example: import applyDirection from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/locale/applyDirection.js&quot;; document.body.dir = &quot;rtl&quot;; applyDirection(); Technical Note: Whenever you change the dir attribute, the browser will automatically re-render that part of the DOM tree (including any Web Components) by default. The applyDirection call is only needed to adjust paddings, margins and other CSS selectors that are not affected by dir. As more advanced CSS features become available in the near future, applyDirection will not be needed and will eventually be deprecated. Compact Mode Some UI5 Web Components support compact mode, meaning they can be rendered with smaller sizes, margins and paddings in order to preserve as much space as possible. To enable compact mode, use any of the following markers on the component itself, the body, html or any other relevant region of your application: data-ui5-compact-size attribute ui5-content-density-compact class Example 1: &lt;body data-ui5-compact-size&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt; (Compact mode is set for all UI5 Web Components on the page.) Example 2: &lt;body&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Button 1&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;div data-ui5-compact-size&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Button 2&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ui5-button class=&quot;ui5-content-density-compact&quot;&gt;Button 3&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;/body&gt; (Compact mode will be set for Button 2 and Button 3.) Unlike RTL, compact mode does not require additional APIs when its markers are changed dynamically. Next: Micro-Frontends and Custom Elements Scoping",

You may also find an ESLint integration for your favorite IDE here. Testing Integration testing is based on Webdriver.io. You can run all tests using npm run test. If reasonable, take the time and write a test for the proposed change or fix. Learn more about testing at the Testing UI5 Web Components page. Git Guidelines We adhere to the Conventional Commits specification. Commit Message Style The commit message consists of three parts: header body (optional) footer (optional) Commit Header The commit header is the first line of the commit message. It consists of three parts: type, scope and description. Commit Type It must be one of the following: fix - a bug fix (note: this will indicate a release). If possible, include a test in your change. feat - a new feature (note: this will indicate a release) docs - documentation only changes style - changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) refactor - a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature perf - a code change that improves performance test - adding missing tests chore - changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation revert - revert to a commit WIP - work in progress Commit Scope (optional) It points to a specific component which is affected by the change. For example, ui5-button, ui5-card and ui5-table. Commit Description Use the imperative present tense. Instead of “I added feature xy” or “Adding tests for” use “Add feature xy” or “Add tests for”. It should be no more than 100 characters long. Commit Body (optional) After the commit header, there should be an empty line followed by the optional commit body. Describe the intention and reasoning of the change. Commit Footer (optional) After the optional commit body, there should be an empty line followed by the optional footer. If the change introduces a breaking change, it should start with BREAKING CHANGE: followed by a description of the change. BREAKING CHANGE: remove press event If the change fixes an issue reported on GitHub, add the following line to the commit message: Fixes #&lt;issueNumber&gt; (e.g. Fixes #42) Example fix(ui5-button): correct focus with &#39;tab&#39; key The button should receive a correct focus outline when the &#39;tab&#39; key is pressed.

    "title": "Custom UI5 Web Components",
    "content": "Developing Custom UI5 Web Components Note: All examples in this tutorial are taken from the Demo UI5 Web Component (ui5-demo), generated by the package initialization script. For more information on creating a new package with a demo Web Component inside, click here. The class definition The main file representing the Web Component is Demo.js. import UI5Element from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js&quot;; import litRender from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/renderer/LitRenderer.js&quot;; import { getI18nBundle } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/i18nBundle.js&quot;; // Template import DemoTemplate from &quot;./generated/templates/DemoTemplate.lit.js&quot;; // Styles import DemoCss from &quot;./generated/themes/Demo.css.js&quot;; import { PLEASE_WAIT } from &quot;./generated/i18n/i18n-defaults.js&quot;; const metadata = { tag: &quot;ui5-demo&quot;, properties: { }, slots: { }, events: { }, }; class Demo extends UI5Element { static get metadata() { return metadata; } static get render() { return litRender; } static get template() { return DemoTemplate; } static get styles() { return DemoCss; } static async onDefine() { Demo.i18nBundle = await getI18nBundle(&quot;my-ui5-web-components&quot;); } get pleaseWaitText() { return Demo.i18nBundle.getText(PLEASE_WAIT); } } Demo.define(); export default Demo; The UI5Element base class Every UI5 Web Component must extend the base class UI5Element, provided by the @ui5/webcomponents-base package: import UI5Element from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js&quot;; class Demo extends UI5Element { } export default Demo; The metadata object Metadata is a JavaScript object, containing information about the public interface of a UI5 Web Component (tag name, properties, slots, events, etc.). Metadata is passed via the metadata static getter: import UI5Element from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js&quot;; const metadata = { tag: &quot;ui5-demo&quot;, properties: { }, slots: { }, events: { }, }; class Demo extends UI5Element { static get metadata() { return metadata; } } export default Demo; So far, we’ve defined a ui5-demo Web Component with no properties, slots or events. For a complete reference to all metadata entities, click here. The render engine UI5 Web Components are agnostic of the DOM render engine used. However, all standard UI5 Web Components (@ui5/webcomponents, @ui5/webcomponents-fiori, etc.) use lit-html as the rendering technology of choice. The render engine is defined via the render static getter: import UI5Element from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js&quot;; import litRender from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/renderer/LitRenderer.js&quot;; const metadata = { tag: &quot;ui5-demo&quot;, properties: { }, slots: { }, events: { }, }; class Demo extends UI5Element { static get metadata() { return metadata; } static get render() { return litRender; } } export default Demo; Here we import LitRenderer.js from the @ui5/webcomponents-base package which is a very tiny wrapper around lit-html. The template Now that we’ve defined the rendering technology of choice, we can pass a template in that technology’s syntax. This is done via the template static getter: import UI5Element from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js&quot;; import litRender from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/renderer/LitRenderer.js&quot;; // Template import DemoTemplate from &quot;./generated/templates/DemoTemplate.lit.js&quot;; const metadata = { tag: &quot;ui5-demo&quot;, properties: { }, slots: { }, events: { }, }; class Demo extends UI5Element { static get metadata() { return metadata; } static get render() { return litRender; } static get template() { return DemoTemplate; } } export default Demo; The standard UI5 Web Components use handlebars templates that are automatically converted to lit-html syntax by the build script. If you have a Demo.hbs file along with the Demo.js file, the build script is going to create for you generated/templates/DemoTemplate.lit.js file. Therefore, we pass the content of this file to the template static getter. For more information, see the next chapter of this tutorial. The CSS definitions You can pass CSS to be inserted in the Shadow Root of the UI5 Web Component by using the styles static getter: import UI5Element from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js&quot;; import litRender from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/renderer/LitRenderer.js&quot;; // Template import DemoTemplate from &quot;./generated/templates/DemoTemplate.lit.js&quot;; // Styles import DemoCss from &quot;./generated/themes/Demo.css.js&quot;; const metadata = { tag: &quot;ui5-demo&quot;, properties: { }, slots: { }, events: { }, }; class Demo extends UI5Element { static get metadata() { return metadata; } static get render() { return litRender; } static get template() { return DemoTemplate; } static get styles() { return DemoCss; } } export default Demo; If you have a themes/Demo.css file, the build script will automatically generate for you a generated/themes/Demo.css.js file, which in addition to your component’s CSS, also contains definitions for all CSS Vars for the default theme. You can define your own CSS Vars for each theme in the respective theme directory in themes/: File Descriptions themes/sap_belize/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_belize theme. themes/sap_belize_hcb/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_belize_hcb theme. themes/sap_fiori_3/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3 theme. themes/sap_fiori_3_dark/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_dark theme. For more information, see the CSS chapter of this tutorial. Defining the Web Component Defining a Web Component is necessary in order to register it in the browser. This is done by calling the UI5Element.define static method: import UI5Element from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js&quot;; import litRender from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/renderer/LitRenderer.js&quot;; // Template import DemoTemplate from &quot;./generated/templates/DemoTemplate.lit.js&quot;; // Styles import DemoCss from &quot;./generated/themes/Demo.css.js&quot;; const metadata = { tag: &quot;ui5-demo&quot;, properties: { }, slots: { }, events: { }, }; class Demo extends UI5Element { static get metadata() { return metadata; } static get render() { return litRender; } static get template() { return DemoTemplate; } static get styles() { return DemoCss; } } Demo.define(); export default Demo; Adding i18n support There are 2 steps to do that: Get and assign an i18n bundle during component definition await Demo.i18nBundle = getI18nBundle(&quot;my-ui5-web-components&quot;); Get texts from the bundle, according to the currently configured language return Demo.i18nBundle.getText(PLEASE_WAIT); The getI18nBundle method is provided by the i18nBundle.js module from the @ui5/webcomponents-base package. So the final source code is: import UI5Element from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/UI5Element.js&quot;; import litRender from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/renderer/LitRenderer.js&quot;; import { getI18nBundle } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/i18nBundle.js&quot;; // Template import DemoTemplate from &quot;./generated/templates/DemoTemplate.lit.js&quot;; // Styles import DemoCss from &quot;./generated/themes/Demo.css.js&quot;; import { PLEASE_WAIT } from &quot;./generated/i18n/i18n-defaults.js&quot;; const metadata = { tag: &quot;ui5-demo&quot;, properties: { }, slots: { }, events: { }, }; class Demo extends UI5Element { static get metadata() { return metadata; } static get render() { return litRender; } static get template() { return DemoTemplate; } static get styles() { return DemoCss; } static async onDefine() { Demo.i18nBundle = await getI18nBundle(&quot;my-ui5-web-components&quot;); } get pleaseWaitText() { return Demo.i18nBundle.getText(PLEASE_WAIT); } } Demo.define(); export default Demo; Please, note that here we use the onDefine method of UI5Element in order to ensure that i18n resources have been fetched before the Web Component has been defined. The used namespace for resource registration (in this example my-ui5-web-components) is the name property of your package.json file. The template file The template of the Web Component is in the Demo.hbs file. In this particular example it looks like this: &lt;div&gt;This is: ui5-demo. &lt;/div&gt; The context in the template is the Web Component instance, therefore you can directly use any properties/getters on the object. Here, we see the pleaseWaitText getter, defined in the previous step. As explained above, the .hbs file is transformed by the build script to a .js file in the lit-html syntax. More specifically, this file is provided to the Web Component class. The CSS Let’s inspect the following files (one with CSS declarations, the others with CSS Vars values for the themes). File Purpose themes/Demo.css All CSS rules for the Web Component, same for all themes; will be inserted in the shadow root. themes/sap_belize/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_belize theme. themes/sap_belize_hcb/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_belize_hcb theme. themes/sap_fiori_3/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3 theme. themes/sap_fiori_3_dark/parameters-bundle.css Values for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_dark theme. In the Demo.css file, in addition to other selectors, we have: :host { border: 2px solid var(--ui5-demo-border-color); background-color: var(--sapBackgroundColor); color: var(--sapTextColor); } The CSS vars, starting with --sap are standard and provided by the framework. All the rest are custom for the specific Web Component. Respectively, the definitions file for, let’s say sap_fiori_3, contains: :root { --ui5-demo-border-color: green; } What’s important to understand here is that you author all the .css files listed in the table above, but the build script generates from them a single .js file for you, and this is namely the file you pass to the Web Component class: generated/themes/Demo.css.js.

    "content": "Custom Fonts The data-ui5-font-face Font-Face style Tag Upon boot, the UI5 Web Components framework creates a &lt;style data-ui5-font-face&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; in order to load the necessary fonts. For example: &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot; data-ui5-font-face=&quot;&quot;&gt; @font-face { font-family: &quot;72&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; src: local(&quot;72&quot;), url(https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/resources/sap/ui/core/themes/sap_fiori_3/fonts/72-Regular.woff2?ui5-webcomponents) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/resources/sap/ui/core/themes/sap_fiori_3/fonts/72-Regular.woff?ui5-webcomponents) format(&quot;woff&quot;); } ................ &lt;/style&gt; Important: Notice the data-ui5-font-face attribute. It is unique and recognized by UI5 Web Components. Customizing Fonts You might need to customize fonts for several reasons: To provide different paths for the fonts (e.g. no public internet connection on the server). To provide additional declarations inside @font-face. To download additional fonts, such as e.g. 72-Light. Not to download any of the default fonts. To do that, just create a &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot; data-ui5-font-face=&quot;&quot;&gt; tag in the head of your HTML page and provide arbitrary content for it. Then, when the UI5 Web Components framework boots, it will detect the existence of this tag by the data-ui5-font-face attribute, and will not create it. The one you provided will be used instead. Example In order to use the 72-Light font in your app and have an additional setting (font-display), you could add the following markup in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML page: &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot; data-ui5-font-face=&quot;&quot;&gt; @font-face { font-family: &quot;72&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 200; font-display: swap; src: local(&quot;72-Light&quot;), url(https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/resources/sap/ui/core/themes/sap_fiori_3/fonts/72-Light.woff2?ui5-webcomponents) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/resources/sap/ui/core/themes/sap_fiori_3/fonts/72-Light.woff?ui5-webcomponents) format(&quot;woff&quot;); } &lt;/style&gt;",

In order to do so, you have to follow the steps below: 1. Install Ruby. See how to install Ruby depending on your OS here. Note: Some OS might come with built-in Ruby, so you don’t have to install it on your own. (To check if Ruby is installed, run ruby -v in the terminal.) 2. Install Bundler. Bundler is a tool for managing dependencies in Ruby. You need to install version 2.02 of Bundler. In order to install it run: gem install bundler -v 2.0.2 3. Go to the playground package. 4. Install all of the playground dependencies. bundle install 5. Go to the project root folder. 6. Start the playground locally. In your terminal, run the following command: yarn start:playground This will build all the necessary assets and will start local server on your machine.

    "title": "Scoping",
    "content": "Micro-Frontends and Custom Elements Scoping What does scoping mean? The scoping feature lets you add an arbitrary suffix to the names of all UI5 Web Components’ custom elements: Example: import { setCustomElementsScopingSuffix } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CustomElementsScope.js&quot;; setCustomElementsScopingSuffix(&quot;demo&quot;); Then all names can only be used with the supplied suffix: &lt;ui5-card-demo&gt; &lt;ui5-title-demo&gt;This card is scoped&lt;/ui5-title-demo&gt; &lt;ui5-button-demo&gt;Click me&lt;/ui5-button-demo&gt; &lt;/ui5-card-demo&gt; Trying to use them with the standard names will not work (the custom elements won’t be upgraded), so for example the following: &lt;ui5-button&gt;Click me&lt;/ui5-button&gt; will not have any effect. When do I need to use the scoping feature? The scoping feature is completely optional. It is not needed for application development, but it is strongly recommended when building libraries and micro-frontends. It ensures that the custom elements that your code uses have not already been reserved by another library or an older version of UI5 Web Components. If, for example, your code may be loaded on demand by unknown applications as a third-party service, there is always the risk that the app or another third-party library, loaded by the app, may use an older version of UI5 Web Components which means that all custom elements will be upgraded with this version, while your code may rely on newer features. Imagine the following integration scenario of an app, using several third-party libraries, loaded on demand (and not bundled with the app): &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- Application code, using UI5 Web Components version 1.0.1 --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;application-container&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-title&gt;This is the new app with many third-party extensions!&lt;/ui5-title&gt; &lt;ui5-card&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Hello&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;ui5-input&gt;&lt;/ui5-input&gt; &lt;/ui5-card&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- Code inserted by &quot;common help&quot; library, using UI5 Web Components version 1.2.0 --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;common-help-container&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-button-chlp new-button-prop=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Help Menu&lt;/ui5-button-chlp&gt; &lt;ui5-input-chlp value=&quot;Type your question&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-input-chlp&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- Code inserted by &quot;global footer&quot; library, using UI5 Web Components version 1.3.0 --&gt; &lt;footer id=&quot;global-footer-container&quot;&gt; &lt;global-footer-main&gt; &lt;ui5-button-glob-foot new-button-prop=&quot;2&quot; even-newer-button-prop=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Profile&lt;/ui5-button-glob-foot&gt; &lt;ui5-link-glob-foot&gt;Contacts&lt;/ui5-link-glob-foot&gt; &lt;/global-footer-main&gt; &lt;/footer&gt; &lt;/body&gt; In the example above: The app itself is using an old version (1.0.1) of UI5 Web Components (which has already upgraded the ui5-card, ui5-button and ui5-input tags). The imaginary “common help” library, based on a newer version (1.2.0), uses the scoping suffix chlp. The imaginary “global footer” library, based on an even newer version (1.3.0), uses the scoping suffix glob-foot. This allows the libraries to use new ui5-button properties such as newButtonProp and evenNewerButtonProp that are not found in older versions. How can I fine-tune the scoping feature? import { setCustomElementsScopingSuffix, setCustomElementsScopingRules } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CustomElementsScope.js&quot;; setCustomElementsScopingSuffix(&quot;demo&quot;); setCustomElementsScopingRules({include: [/^ui5-/], exclude: [/^ui5-my-/, /-test-/]}); By default, all UI5 Web Components starting with ui5- are scoped when you call setCustomElementsScopingSuffix. However, you have full control over which tags are scoped and which not. In the example above, tags starting with ui5-my- and tags having the word -test- in their name are not scoped. Setting scoping rules is handy if, for example, your library uses both standard and custom UI5 Web Components and you don’t want to scope the custom ones (as no disambiguation will be necessary for them).

    "title": "Understanding components APIs",
    "content": "Understanding UI5 Web Components APIs UI5 Web Components are just HTML. Therefore, their usage is identical to the usage of standard HTML elements. Usually, Web Components creation and manipulation will be done internally by your framework of choice. This section explains UI5 Web Components APIs and usage in general terms. UI5 Web Components provide the following kinds of APIs: API Category Description properties / attributes Define the look and behavior of the component slots Define whether you can put text or other HTML elements (and if yes, what kind) as DOM children of the component events Define what events the component fires due to user interaction public methods Methods you can call on the component 1. How do I create a UI5 Web Component instance? The simplest way is to just add it somewhere in the &lt;body&gt; of your HTML page. &lt;ui5-button&gt;Click me&lt;/ui5-button&gt; You can also use document.createElement and then manually add the element to the HTML document. const myButton = document.createElement(&quot;ui5-button&quot;); document.body.appendChild(myButton); In most real-world scenarios, the above will be done by your framework of choice. 2. How do I set the properties/attributes of UI5 Web Components? You can use attributes and properties to the same effect. Keep in mind that attribute names are “kebab-case” (e.g. value-state) while property names are “camelCase” (e.g. valueState). Attributes can be set directly on the web component in HTML. &lt;ui5-checkbox id=&quot;cb&quot; value-state=&quot;Error&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-checkbox&gt; Properties can only be set programmatically. To set a property: const myCb = document.getElementById(&quot;cb&quot;); myCb.valueState = &quot;Error&quot;; To set an attribute: const myCb = document.getElementById(&quot;cb&quot;); myCb.setAttribute(&quot;value-state&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;); A note on Boolean attributes: in HTML Boolean attributes may have no value or any value (most commonly same as their name). In any case, the presence of the attribute means it is “true” and its absence - “false”. const myCb = document.getElementById(&quot;cb&quot;); myCb.setAttribute(&quot;checked&quot;, &quot;&quot;); // same as myCB.checked = true; myCb.removeAttribute(&quot;checked&quot;); // same as myCB.checked = false; 3. How do I set the content of UI5 Web Components? Some UI5 Web Components do not accept children or text. They are only modified by properties and attributes. An example of such a Web Component is the ui5-icon: &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;add&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-icon&gt; The icon accepts no text or other HTML elements inside its opening and closing tags. Therefore, in the next example, the text inside the &lt;ui5-icon&gt; will be ignored. &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;add&quot;&gt;This is an icon&lt;/ui5-icon&gt; Other UI5 Web Components, such as &lt;ui5-button&gt; accept text (and in addition HTML elements that make sense when writing text). &lt;ui5-button id=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;This is the content of the button&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;content&gt; of the button&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;This is the &lt;span class=&quot;myClass&quot;&gt;content&lt;span&gt; of the button&lt;/ui5-button&gt; You can change the content of these elements with any suitable DOM API. const myButton = document.getElementById(&quot;btn&quot;); myButton.textContent = &quot;New text&quot;; myButton.innerHTML = &quot;New text&quot;; // same effect as above myButton.childNodes[0].nodeValue = &quot;New text&quot; // same result again Usually, you’ll never have to do this manually either, as you’ll bind the content of the button via the means provided by the framework you’re using, and the framework will be the one updating it for you. Finally, there are UI5 Web Components that only accept other HTML elements. For example &lt;ui5-popover&gt; may contain any HTML element - standard elements and other custom elements alike. &lt;ui5-popover&gt; &lt;div&gt;This is my content&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is some more content&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Button on a popover&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;/ui5-popover&gt; Manipulating the content of such Web Components is done again with the standard DOM APIs. For example, to add something else to the popover above: const popover = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ui5-popover&quot;)[0]; const newChild = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); popover.appendChild(newChild); Again, normally you won’t need to do this manually, but your framework will do it for you. Now, let’s have a look at a Web Component that is intended to have only certain children: &lt;ui5-tabcontainer id=&quot;tc1&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-tab text=&quot;Laptops&quot; additional-text=&quot;125&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab&gt; &lt;ui5-tab-separator&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab-separator&gt; &lt;ui5-tab text=&quot;Phones&quot; design=&quot;Positive&quot; additional-text=&quot;25&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab&gt; &lt;ui5-tab text=&quot;Tablets&quot; design=&quot;Negative&quot; additional-text=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab&gt; &lt;/ui5-tabcontainer&gt; The &lt;ui5-tabcontainer&gt; should only contain &lt;ui5-tab&gt; and &lt;ui5-tab-separator&gt;. The manipulation is exactly the same as with the other Web Components. For example, to add a new tab: const tc = document.getElementById(&quot;tc1&quot;); const newTab = document.createElement(&quot;ui5-tab&quot;); newTab.text = &quot;Smart Watches&quot;; newTab.design = &quot;Positive&quot;; tc.appendChild(newTab); And finally, some UI5 Web Components may render their children in different places, depending on the purpose of each child. Let’s have a look at the &lt;ui5-popover&gt; again. After consulting the documentation, we can see that this particular Web Component accepts three categories of children: default, footer, header. For footer and header the children can be any type of HTML Element (hence HTMLElement), while for default they can be both HTML Elements and text (hence Node). To tell the &lt;ui5-popover&gt; which child goes where, use the slot attribute on it. &lt;ui5-popover&gt; &lt;div slot=&quot;header&quot;&gt;This will be used as a header&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Some popover content&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Some more content&lt;/div&gt; This text will also go to the default slot. &lt;div slot=&quot;footer&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Do some action&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/ui5-popover&gt; You do not have to supply the slot attribute for the default slot of any Web Component. Also, since text nodes cannot have attributes in HTML, this also means that only the default slot can accept text (can be of type Node) and all text nodes go there. Every UI5 Web Component that has slots, has at least a default slot. Here’s a summary of slot types: Slot Type Allowed Children Example Node All HTML elements and text ui5-button default slot HTMLElement HTML elements only (no text) ui5-popover header slot 4. How do I listen for events? For this task, you can again use standard DOM methods: const myMessage = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ui5-message-strip&quot;)[0]; myMessage.addEventListener(&quot;close&quot;, () =&gt; { console.log(&quot;The user dismissed the message&quot;); }); const myButton = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ui5-button&quot;)[0]; myButton.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, () =&gt; { console.log(&quot;The user clicked the button&quot;); }); For the events fired by each UI5 Web Component, consult the documentation. Like with most other tasks, you’ll use your framework’s syntax to bind to events, and you’ll rarely, if ever, need to call addEventListener yourself. Please, note, however that some frameworks (e.g. React) cannot use their standard syntax for binding to custom events (such as close), but only for standard ones (such as click). So, for custom events in React you’d have to get a reference to the element and call addEventListener manually. For more information, please check our React tutorial. 5. How do I call public methods? Get a reference to the UI5 Web Component and call the method on it, as you would with any other HTML element. const myDialog = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ui5-dialog&quot;)[0]; myDialog.show(); Consult the documentation for the available public methods for each UI5 Web Component. 6. Conclusion As you can see from this article, UI5 Web Components, being HTML elements in the first place, comply with the same rules. There are some novelties that come with the Web Components standard, such as slot, but otherwise everything else is what you already know and use from HTML. Next: Using Icons",

    "title": "Understanding components metadata",
    "content": "Understanding UI5 Web Components Metadata Metadata is a JavaScript object, containing information about the public interface of a UI5 Web Component (tag name, properties, etc.). Disclaimer: The information below is for UI5 Web Components development only. It is experimental and may change. Tag Defines the HTML tag for the Web Component. Example: { &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;ui5-my-element&quot;, } Properties / Attributes Defines the HTML properties for the Web Component. Note about attributes: By default, for each property an equivalent attribute is supported. Attributes have the same names as properties, but in kebab-case rather than camelCase. Properties of type Object, properties with multiple set totrue and properties with noAttribute set to true do not have an attribute equivalent. Example { &quot;properties&quot;: { &quot;message&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: String, &quot;defaultValue&quot;: &quot;Hello&quot;, }, &quot;shown&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: Boolean, &quot;noAttribute&quot;: true, }, &quot;settings&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: Object, }, &quot;nums&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: Integer, &quot;multiple&quot;: true, }, &quot;animationDuration&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: Integer, }, &quot;width&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: CSSSize, &quot;defaultValue&quot;: &quot;&quot;, }, }, } Property configuration settings Setting Type Default Description type Property type N/A The type of the property. For more information on types see the table below. defaultValue Any valid value for the type undefined Default value of the property. Cannot be set for type “Boolean”. Booleans are always false by default in HTML. multiple Boolean false Indicates whether the property represents a single value or is an array of values of the given type. noAttribute Boolean false No attribute equivalent will be created for that property. Always true for properties of type Object. The type setting is required. Types Type Class to Use Description string String String value boolean Boolean Boolean value - always false by default object Object JS Object custom type Extend @ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/types/DataType.js Used mainly for enumerations Examples of prebuilt custom types Type Class to Use Description Integer @ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/types/Integer.js Integer value CSSSize @ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/types/CSSSize.js Any valid CSS size definition (px, rem, etc.) ValueState @ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/types/ValueState.js Enumeration with: None, Error, Warning, Success values Slots Defines the slots that will be provided by this UI5 Web Component. Example { &quot;slots&quot;: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: Node, }, &quot;footer&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: HTMLElement, }, &quot;rows&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: HTMLElement, &quot;individualSlots&quot;: true, } } } Slot configuration settings Setting Type Default Description type * HTMLElement or Node N/A The type of the children that can go into that slot. individualSlots Boolean false If set to true, each child will have its own slot, allowing you to arrange/wrap the children arbitrarily. propertyName String N/A Allows to set the name of the property on the Web Component, where the children belonging to this slot will be stored. invalidateOnChildChange ** Boolean or Object false Experimental, do not use. Defines whether every invalidation of a UI5 Web Component in this slot should trigger an invalidation of the parent UI5 Web Component. * The type setting is required. ** Important: invalidateOnChildChange is not meant to be used with standard DOM Elements and is not to be confused with MutationObserver-like functionality. It rather targets the use case of components that slot abstract items (UI5Element instances without a template) and require to be invalidated in turn whenever these items are invalidated. The invalidateOnChildChange setting can be either a Boolean (true meaning invalidate the component on any change of a child in this slot) or an Object with properties and slots fields. They in turn can be either of type Boolean (true meaning invalidate on any property change or any slot change) or Array of strings indicating exactly which properties or slots lead to invalidation. Examples: In the following example, since invalidateOnChildChange is not used (false by default), the component will be invalidated whenever children are added/removed in the tabs slot, but not whenever a child in that slot changes. { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;HTMLElement&quot;, &quot;propertyName&quot;: &quot;tabs&quot;, } } } Setting invalidateOnChildChange to true means: invalidate the component whenever a child in the tabs slot gets invalidated, regardless of the reason. { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;HTMLElement&quot;, &quot;propertyName&quot;: &quot;tabs&quot;, &quot;invalidateOnChildChange&quot;: true } } } The example below results in exactly the same behavior as the one above, but it uses the more explicit Object format: { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;HTMLElement&quot;, &quot;propertyName&quot;: &quot;tabs&quot;, &quot;invalidateOnChildChange&quot;: { &quot;properties&quot;: true, &quot;slots&quot;: true } } } } The following example uses the Object format again and means: invalidate the component whenever the children in this slot are invalidated due to property changes, but not due to slot changes. Here &quot;slots&quot;: false is added for completeness (as false is the default value for both properties and slots) { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;HTMLElement&quot;, &quot;propertyName&quot;: &quot;tabs&quot;, &quot;invalidateOnChildChange&quot;: { &quot;properties&quot;: true, &quot;slots&quot;: false } } } } The final example shows the most complex format of invalidateOnChildChange which allows to define which slots or properties in the children inside that slot lead to invalidation of the component: { managedSlots: true, slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;HTMLElement&quot;, &quot;propertyName&quot;: &quot;tabs&quot;, &quot;invalidateOnChildChange&quot;: { &quot;properties&quot;: [&quot;text&quot;, &quot;selected&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot;], &quot;slots&quot;: [&quot;default&quot;] } } } } Notes: Children without a slot attribute will be assigned to the default slot. All HTML text nodes will be assigned to the default slot, as they cannot have a slot attribute. For all slots the Web Component will have a property created, with the name of the slot, to hold a list of all children assigned to this slot. For example, if you have a slot named “rows”, “this.rows” will be an array, holding references to all children with slot=&quot;rows&quot;, or no slot, if rows was default. For the default slot you can provide a propertyName setting. For example, if your default slot has a propertyName: &quot;items&quot;, then “this.items” will hold all children that were assigned to the default slot. #### Allowed slot types Type Description Node Accepts both Text nodes and HTML Elements HTMLElement Accepts HTML Elements only Managed slots Determines whether the framework should manage the slots of this UI5 Web Component. This setting is useful for UI5 Web Components that don’t just slot children, but additionally base their own rendering on the presence/absence/type of children. { &quot;managedSlots&quot;: true } When managedSlots is set to true: The framework will invalidate this UI5 Web Component, whenever its children are added/removed/rearranged (and additionally when invalidated, if invalidateOnChildChange is set). If any of this UI5 Web Component’s children are custom elements, the framework will await until they are all defined and upgraded, before rendering the component for the first time. The framework will create properties for each slot on this UI5 Web Component’s instances for easier access to the slotted children. For example, if there are header, content and footer slots, there will be respectively header, content and footer properties of type Array holding the slotted children for each slot. Note: You can use the propertyName metadata entity, described above, to modify these. In essence, set this to true if the UI5 Web Component you’re developing should be aware of its children for the purposes of its own state management and rendering (contrary to just displaying them). An example of a component that would benefit from managedSlots is a Tab Container that monitors its children (Tabs) in order to display a link on its Tab Strip for each Tab child. Therefore, it would need to be invalidated whenever Tabs are added/removed, in order to update its own state and visualization. Next: Testing UI5 Web Components",

    "title": "Testing UI5 Web Components",
    "content": "Testing UI5 Web Components Note: All examples in this tutorial are taken from the demo UI5 Web Component (ui5-demo), generated by the package initialization script. For more information on creating a new package with a demo Web Component inside, click here. 1. Prerequisites The test framework of choice for UI5 Web Components is WebdriverIO or WDIO for short. It has a straightforward API - https://webdriver.io/docs/api.html, and has excellent support for Web Components. The browser of choice for test execution is Google Chrome, respectively the used WebDriver is ChromeDriver. Managing ChromeDriver ChromeDriver is a peer dependency of @ui5/webcomponents-tools. Therefore, you are expected to install and upgrade it manually. You can install it with npm: npm i --save-dev chromedriver or with yarn: yarn add -D chromedriver Google Chrome and ChromeDriver need to be the same version to work together. Whenever you update Google Chrome on your system (or it updates automatically, if allowed), you are expected to also update ChromeDriver to the respective version. 2. Running the tests 2.1 Test configuration The configuration for WDIO can be found in the config/ directory under wdio.conf.js. As explained here in the section about the config/ directory, you can customize, or even completely replace the default configuration. However, before doing so, please note the following two benefits of working with the default configuration, provided by UI5 Web Components: Hooks, synchronizing the execution of all relevant WDIO commands (e.g. click, url, $, $$) with the rendering of the framework to ensure consistency when reading or changing the state of the components. Additional API methods: setProperty, setAttribute, removeAttribute, hasClass. So our recommendation would be to modify it, if necessary, but not completely replace it. 2.2 Running all tests npm run test or yarn test This will launch a static server and execute all tests found in the test/specs/ directory of your package. Note: Before running the tests for the first time, make sure you’ve built the project, or at least the dev server is running (build or start commands). 2.3 Running a single test spec npm run test test/specs/Demo.spec.js or yarn test test/specs/Demo.spec.js Note: Executing a single test spec only makes sense for debugging purposes, therefore no test server is launched for it. Make sure you’re running the start command while running single test specs, as it provides a server and the ability to change files, and test the changes on the fly. 3. Writing tests The simplest test would look something like this: describe(&quot;ui5-demo rendering&quot;, async () =&gt; { await browser.url(&quot;test/pages/index.html&quot;); it(&quot;tests if web component is correctly rendered&quot;, async () =&gt; { const innerContent = await browser.$(&quot;#myFirstComponent&quot;).shadow$(&quot;div&quot;); assert.ok(innerContent, &quot;content rendered&quot;); }); }); Key points: Load the test page with the browser.url command. You can do this once for each test suite or for each individual test. You can access the Web Components with $ or $$. You can access the shadow roots with shadow$ or shadow$$. Simulate mouse interaction with the Web Components by calling the click command on the Web Component itself or certain parts of its shadow root. Simulate keyboard with the keys command. You can read the DOM with commands such as getHTML, getProperty, getAttribute, etc. You can modify the DOM with commands such as setProperty, setAttribute etc. For WDIO capabilities, see: Official API: https://webdriver.io/docs/api.html. Additional commands provided in our standard WDIO configuration: setProperty, setAttribute, removeAttribute, hasClass. Note: The standard WDIO configuration we provide automatically synchronizes all test commands’ execution with the framework rendering cycle. Therefore, in the example above, the shadow$ command will internally wait for all rendering to be over before being executed. The same holds true for commands that modify the DOM such as setAttribute or click. 4. Debugging tests Debugging with WDIO is really simple. Just follow these 3 steps: Change the WDIO configuration file config/wdio.conf.js to disable headless mode for Google Chrome as follows: From: module.exports = require(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-tools/components-package/wdio.js&quot;); to: const result = require(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-tools/components-package/wdio.js&quot;); result.config.capabilities[0][&quot;goog:chromeOptions&quot;].args = [&#39;--disable-gpu&#39;]; // From: [&#39;--disable-gpu&#39;, &#39;--headless&#39;] module.exports = result; If you happen to debug often, it’s recommended to keep the file in this format and just comment out the middle line when you’re done debugging. Set a breakpoint with browser.debug somewhere in your test: it(&quot;tests if web component is correctly rendered&quot;, async () =&gt; { const innerContent = await browser.$(&quot;#myFirstComponent&quot;).shadow$(&quot;div&quot;); await browser.debug(); assert.ok(innerContent, &quot;content rendered&quot;); }); For more on debug, see https://webdriver.io/docs/api/browser/debug.html. Run the single test spec and wait for the browser to open and pause on your breakpoint: Run the dev server, if you haven’t already: yarn start or npm run start. Run the single test spec: yarn test test/specs/Demo.spec.js or npm run test test/specs/Demo.spec.js. Google Chrome will then open in a new window, controlled by WDIO via the ChromeDriver, and your test will pause on your breakpoint of choice. Proceed to debug normally. 5. Best practices for writing tests Do not overuse assert.ok When an assert.ok fails, the error you get is “Expected something to be true, but it was false”. This is fine when you’re passing a Boolean, but not ok when there is an expression inside assert.ok and you’d like to know which part of the expression is not as expected. For example, when assert.ok(a === b, &quot;They match&quot;) fails, the error just says that an expression that was expected to be true was false. However, if you use assert.strictEqual(a, b, &quot;They match&quot;), and it fails, the error will say that a was expected to be a certain value, but it was another value, which makes it much easier to debug. Prefer one of the following, when applicable: assert.notOk(a) instead of assert.ok(!a) assert.strictEqual(a, b) instead of assert.ok(a === b) assert.isBelow(a, b) instead of assert.ok(a &lt; b) assert.isAbove(a, b) instead of assert.ok(a &gt; b) assert.exists / assert.notExists when checking for null or undefined Do not overuse assert.strictEqual Use: assert.ok instead of assert.strictEqual(a, true) assert.notOk instead of assert.strictEqual(a, false) Use isExisting to check DOM Preferred: assert.ok(await browser.$(&lt;SELECTOR&gt;).isExisting()) instead of: assert.ok((await browser.$$(&lt;SELECTOR&gt;)).length) Do not use browser.executeAsync for properties We have custom commands such as getProperty and setProperty to fill in gaps in the WDIO standard command set. Use them instead of manually setting properties with executeAsync. Use assert.include instead of string functions Use: assert.include(text, EXPECTED_TEXT, &quot;Text found&quot;) assert.notInclude(text, NOT_EXPECTED_TEXT, &quot;Text not found&quot;) instead of: assert.ok(text.indexOf(EXPECTED_TEXT) &gt; -1, &quot;Text found&quot;) assert.ok(text.includes(EXPECTED_TEXT), &quot;Text found&quot;) assert.notOk(text.includes(NOT_EXPECTED_TEXT), &quot;Text not found&quot;) Extract variables before asserting Avoid complex expressions inside asserts by extracting parts of them to variables and only asserting the variables. 6. Using the synchronous syntax for writing texts WebdriverIO still supports (although now deprecated) the synchronous syntax for writing tests. Click here for more information on “sync vs async”. UI5 Web Components versions up to, including, 1.0.0-rc.15, used to recommend the synchronous syntax, as it is easier to use. If you have already written tests for your custom UI5 Web Components using the synchronous syntax, and you update to a later version than 1.0.0-rc.15, your tests will no longer run. You have 2 options: Rewrite all tests to use the asynchronous syntax. Click the link above to see some examples. This is the recommended approach, because the synchronous syntax will no longer work with future nodejs versions. For the time being, adapt your WebdriverIO configuration to continue supporting the synchronous syntax. 5.1 Supporting the synchronous syntax for writing tests Change your config/wdio.conf.js file’s content from: module.exports = require(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-tools/components-package/wdio.js&quot;); to: module.exports = require(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-tools/components-package/wdio.sync.js&quot;); This will give you the exact same WebdriverIO configuration, but with synchronous custom commands (such as getProperty, setProperty, hasClass, etc.). Manually install @wdio/sync You can install it with npm: npm i --save-dev @wdio/sync or with yarn: yarn add -D @wdio/sync Just installing the package (with no extra configuration) is enough to let WebdriverIO run the synchronous tests.",

Additionally, several UI5 Web Components have an icon property that expects an icon name as a value. Icon Collections The UI5 Web Components project currently offers 3 icon collections, provided as NPM packages: Project NPM Package Description Icons list icons UI5 Web Components - Icons A rich icon collection (SAP-icons), suitable for enterprise-grade apps Explore icons-tnt UI5 Web Components - Icons TNT A rich icon collection (SAP-icons-TNT), suitable for more technical apps Explore icons-business-suite UI5 Web Components - Icons Business Suite A rich icon collection (BusinessSuiteInAppSymbols), suitable for SAP Fiori apps Explore Usage Add one or more of the above packages as dependencies to your project. npm i @ui5/webcomponents-icons npm i @ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt npm i @ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite Import either all icons from a package, or better - only the ones your app is going to use. Important: It is strongly recommended that you only import the icons that your app is going to use. This will keep your bundle small. Generally, importing all icons is required only if you do not know in advance which icons you are going to need. To import all icons from a package, use the dist/AllIcons.js module of that package: import &quot;@ui5/&lt;PACKAGE-NAME&gt;/dist/AllIcons.js&quot;; For example: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/AllIcons.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt/dist/AllIcons.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite/dist/AllIcons.js&quot;; To import individual icons, use the individual modules for the required icons: import &quot;@ui5/&lt;PACKAGE-NAME&gt;/dist/&lt;ICON-NAME&gt;.js&quot;; For example: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/alert.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/bookmark.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/cart.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt/dist/actor.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite/dist/add-point.js&quot;; Once an icon has been imported, it can be used. All collections but @ui5/webcomponents-icons require a prefix before the icon name. The prefix and icon name are separated by a /. Package Prefix Example @ui5/webcomponents-icons N/A alert @ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt tnt tnt/actor @ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite business-suite business-suite/coins For example: &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-icon&gt; &lt;ui5-button icon=&quot;tnt/actor&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;ui5-avatar icon=&quot;business-suite/coins&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-avatar&gt; Next: Using Additional Assets",

    "title": "Using i18n for apps",
    "content": "UI5 Web Components i18n for Apps This section explains how to use the UI5 Web Components i18n functionality for the purpose of your app’s translatable texts. None of the code below implies or requires the usage of UI5 Web Components, and can be used completely stand-alone. The @ui5/webcomponents-base package allows the usage of i18n functionality not just for UI5 Web Components, but for apps as well. Note: This section is dedicated to apps. For information on how to set up i18n for your custom components, please see Developing Web Components. Step-by-Step Tutorial This tutorial will show you how to use the UI5 Web Components i18n functionality for the purpose of your apps. 1. Start by creating some i18n resources in .properties format in a directory that can be served, for example: File Content assets/messagebundle_de.properties PLEASE_WAIT=Bitte warten assets/messagebundle_fr.properties PLEASE_WAIT=Patientez. assets/messagebundle_es.properties PLEASE_WAIT=Espere assets/messagebundle_en.properties PLEASE_WAIT=Please wait (This example demonstrates just one translatable text per file for simplicity. You can have any number of texts per file, each on a new line.) 2. Import the following i18n-related modules to your app: import parseProperties from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/PropertiesFileFormat.js&quot;; import { registerI18nLoader, getI18nBundle } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/i18nBundle.js&quot;; The first one provides support for .properties files, as used in the example, and the second one - the functions that will allow you to take advantage of the i18n functionality. 3. Register a loader function that can retrieve and process the actual content of your message bundles: const supportedLocales = [&quot;en&quot;, &quot;fr&quot;, &quot;de&quot;, &quot;es&quot;]; supportedLocales.forEach(localeToRegister =&gt; { registerI18nLoader(&quot;myApp&quot;, localeToRegister, async (localeId) =&gt; { const props = await (await fetch(`./assets/messagebundle_${localeId}.properties`)).text(); return parseProperties(props); }); }); The first argument to registerI18nLoader is an ID that will be used to reference this message bundle, the second is the locale this loader can load, and the third is a function that can load and process the content for the specified package/locale combination. Note: For more assets, a loop is used to register a loader for each package/locale combination. The same loader function can be registered and its parameter can be used to distinguish which locale resource is requested. Note: This step takes care of registering assets only, no data will be fetched at this point. 4. Get and use the bundle: const bundle = await getI18nBundle(&quot;myApp&quot;); const pleaseWait = bundle.getText(&quot;PLEASE_WAIT&quot;); console.log(&quot;Please wait in the current language is: &quot;, pleaseWait); You can pass multiple additional values to getText for texts with placeholders. If your text looks like this CAROUSEL_DOT_TEXT=Item {0} of {1} displayed you can call getText bundle.getText(&quot;CAROUSEL_DOT_TEXT&quot;, 5, 20); which will finally result in Item 5 of 20 displayed. 5. Test your page using different languages, e.g. set ?sap-ui-language=de in the URL or change the configuration. Summary The whole code would look like this: import parseProperties from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/PropertiesFileFormat.js&quot;; import { registerI18nLoader, getI18nBundle } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/i18nBundle.js&quot;; const supportedLocales = [&quot;en&quot;, &quot;fr&quot;, &quot;de&quot;, &quot;es&quot;]; supportedLocales.forEach(localeToRegister =&gt; { registerI18nLoader(&quot;myApp&quot;, localeToRegister, async (localeId) =&gt; { const props = await (await fetch(`./assets/messagebundle_${localeId}.properties`)).text(); return parseProperties(props); }); }); const bundle = await getI18nBundle(&quot;myApp&quot;); const pleaseWait = bundle.getText(&quot;PLEASE_WAIT&quot;); console.log(&quot;Please wait in the current language is: &quot;, pleaseWait); You register your assets for all supported languages, then you fetch the data for the currently active language, get a reference to the bundle and call the getText method to get texts for your app. Tips and Tricks You can skip the .properties format support import return await (await fetch(`./assets/messagebundle_${localeId}.json`)).json(); and return the data directly in .json format if you want to load a little bit less code in the runtime. File Content assets/messagebundle_de.json {&quot;PLEASE_WAIT&quot;: &quot;Bitte warten&quot;} assets/messagebundle_fr.json {&quot;PLEASE_WAIT&quot;: &quot;Patientez.&quot;} assets/messagebundle_es.json {&quot;PLEASE_WAIT&quot;: &quot;Espere&quot;} assets/messagebundle_en.json {&quot;PLEASE_WAIT&quot;: &quot;Please wait&quot;} Next: Accessibility",

    "title": "Accessibility",
    "content": "Accessibility in UI5 Web Components Accessibility refers to the possibility for everyone, including and especially people with disabilities, to access and use IT products. Making software work for more people should be of high priority. All users should be able to operate our software without loss of meaningful content, functionality, and efficiency when using assistive technologies. Following those principles in an ongoing approach, we at UI5 Web Components aim to bring accessibility to life by providing the appropriate accessibility features, and following precise accessibility requirements and processes. Web Components &amp; Accessibility Web Components allow developers to make their own custom components with native HTML and JavaScript with the usage of custom elements, shadow DOM, and templates. In HTML you can define an element using a role. When you use semantic elements, you don’t need to define a role as these elements receive all relevant aria mappings out of the box. However, this is not the case when you use custom elements where you should add all relevant accessibility attributes yourselves. This is not needed in UI5 Web Components, because when using our elements, all relevant accessibility attributes for a certain component will be applied in the shadow DOM, without further setup. Additionally, many accessibility-related APIs are available. They can be used to enhance the accessibility in the context of each application. As the Web Components are a new standard, there are still some gaps in regard to accessibility. For example - setting IDRef relationships is currently not possible due to the nature of the custom elements and their shadow DOM. This is a limitation in the ARIA support and there is a draft of a new AOM (Accessibility Object Model), which addresses this issue and many more, and aims at a better JS-based accessibility support for all web elements. We are continuously working on improving the existing limitations. For example, in order to create a Label-Input relationship, you could simply use the accessible-name or accessible-name-ref properties of the input components in order to set the accessible name for the desired input. Accessibility Features Many accessibility features are built into the core design elements upfront and are available to app teams out of the box. Keyboard navigation and interaction, tab and reading order, as well as screen reader support are fundamental features enabled in UI5 Web Components. Visualization features like high contrast themes, consistency of icons, keyboard focus visualization, layout adaptation, and support for text resizing are also available. Screen Reader Support UI5 Web Components provide the prerequisites for screen reader support based on the HTML, ARIA, and WCAG standards support in order to aid people using screen reader software. Navigation with the keyboard and screen reader should work properly together. In order for this to happen, you need to use the correct ARIA attributes and to map them to their HTML counterparts. With UI5 Web Components you will receive ARIA mapped elements out of the box. For example let’s add a ui5-combobox component: &lt;ui5-combobox&gt; &lt;ui5-cb-item text=&quot;Item 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-cb-item&gt; &lt;/ui5-combobox&gt; By doing so, you receive an input element with role=&quot;combobox&quot; with all aria attributes relevant for this role in the shadow DOM. Also, if you set the disabled property, this will automatically add disabled to the shadow combobox element. Attribute mapping is available for all relevant properties - required, disabled, readonly, and more. In order to ease the setting of aria attributes, we have introduced properties that are available for developers to extend the accessibility support in the context of the application. More information about the available properties could be found in the Accessibility APIs section below. Keyboard Handling All standard UI elements and controls are designed to be keyboard-enabled. All suitable input channels (such as mouse, keyboard, or touch) are treated equally according to the capabilities of the device or the individual preferences of the user. For example, some users may prefer using the keyboard instead of a mouse, which lets them work faster. Support for standard keystrokes, based on the role of the component element is available. Complex components also provide advanced keyboard handling, which is described in the Overview section of each component. Theming Theming is an important aspect when it comes to a UI5 Web Components application. The different colors shown on the UI need to have a good contrast to each other in order to be easily distinguishable. We ensure that the requirements for color contrast are fulfilled in all themes. High Contrast White and High Contrast Black themes are also available to support people with visual impairments. For more information regarding the available themes and how to use them, see the Configuration section. Accessibility APIs The mapping of the accessibility APIs to ARIA attributes is described in the following table: UI5 Web Components Property HTML attribute Description accessibleName aria-label Defines the text alternative of the component. If not provided, a default text alternative is set, if present. accessibleNameRef aria-label Alternative for aria-labelledby. Receives ID (or many IDs) of the elements that serve as labels of the component. Those labels are passed as a concatenated string to the aria-label attribute. accessibleRole role Sets the accessible aria role of the component. accessibilityTexts aria-label An object of strings that define several additional accessibility texts for further customization. accessibilityAttributes aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-controls An object of strings that defines several additional accessibility attribute values for customization depending on the use case. accessibilityRoles (FlexibleColumnLayout) role An object of strings that define several additional accessibility roles for further customization. required aria-required Defines whether the component is required. readonly aria-readonly Defines whether the component is read-only. disabled aria-disabled Defines whether the component is disabled. checked aria-checked Defines whether the component is checked. level, headerLevel aria-level Defines the heading level of a title. Available options are: “H6” to “H1”. interactive tabindex Defines if the component is interactive (focusable and pressable). accessibleName Setting the property on the custom element as: &lt;ui5-combobox accessible-name=&quot;Enter Value&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-cb-item text=&quot;Item 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-cb-item&gt; &lt;/ui5-combobox&gt; Will result in the shadow DOM as: &lt;input role=&quot;combobox&quot; aria-label=&quot;Enter value&quot; ... &gt; The accessible-name property is currently supported in: Popups: Dialog, Popover User input components (e.g. Input, RadioButton) Panel Breadcrumbs Button Icon List CheckBox Rating Indicator Slider, Range Slider Table accessibleNameRef Setting the property on the custom element as: &lt;ui5-label id=&quot;myLabel&quot; for=&quot;myInput&quot;&gt;Date of birth&lt;/ui5-label&gt; &lt;ui5-input id=&quot;myInput&quot; accessible-name-ref=&quot;myLabel&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-input&gt; Will result in the shadow DOM as: &lt;input aria-label=&quot;Date of birth&quot; ... &gt; The accessible-name-ref property is currently supported in: User input components (e.g. Input, RadioButton) Link Button List CheckBox Table accessibilityTexts This property accepts object with property values for different parts of the FlexibleColumnLayout elements.

All screen readers that follow those standards should work fine. Nevertheless, there are deviations in the interpretation depending on the combination of browser and screen reader. UI5 Web Components focus on compliance with the standards by performing automated checks for accessibility and manual tests with reference testing environments. For Screen Reader Support, we recommend using JAWS 2021 + Chrome (latest), and for HTML/ARIA validation the recommended testing tool is Access Assistant. UI5 Web Components support other environments to the extent of providing a valid HTML and ARIA implementation following the WCAG standards. Please note that reference testing environments may change over time to reflect changes in the usage of different browsers, their maintenance period, and increased accessibility compliance. When reporting issues with different testing environments, please ensure that the issue is not false positive, a real accessibility concern is present, and there is an impact over the users. Therefore, we recommend to retest the issue using the mentioned reference testing tools and additionally with plain HTML. In order to process the issues correctly, we would like to have the following information provided: • Issue description • Reference to the suspected violated accessibility requirement (e.g. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, WCAG 2.0, BITV 2.0, EN 301 549) • Isolated example • Steps to reproduce • UI5 Web Components version • OS/Platform: {…} • Browser: {…} • Testing Tool Next: CSP",

Now, let’s do the same for @ui5/webcomponents-icons: npm install @ui5/webcomponents-icons 2) Change the main.js file as follows: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Assets.js&quot;; // Assets for the main package import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/Assets.js&quot;; // Assets for the icons package import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js&quot;; // ui5-button import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/ColorPalette.js&quot;; // ui5-color-palette import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/ColorPaletteMoreColors.js&quot;; // the &quot;more colors&quot; feature import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/add.js&quot;; // the &quot;add&quot; icon, used inside the button You now import assets, components, features and icons. 3) Change the index.html file as follows: &lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;ui5-button icon=&quot;add&quot;&gt;Button with icon&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;ui5-color-palette show-more-colors&gt; &lt;ui5-color-palette-item value=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-color-palette-item&gt; &lt;ui5-color-palette-item value=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-color-palette-item&gt; &lt;ui5-color-palette-item value=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-color-palette-item&gt; &lt;/ui5-color-palette&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; to use ui5-button with the add icon imported in main.js and the ui5-color-palette component with the show-more-colors feature. 4) Run the project. If vite is running, it will just refresh your browser, otherwise run the project again. npm run dev Go to your browser and observe the changes. 5) Test the assets. Try running the test page with the following URL parameters: sap-ui-theme=sap_belize_hcb&amp;sap-ui-language=de http://localhost:3000/?sap-ui-theme=sap_belize_hcb&amp;sap-ui-language=de You should be able to see the page with an accessibility theme, and in German language.",

    "title": "CSP",
    "content": "CSP To learn about Content Security Policy (CSP), click here. Read this section if your site needs to be CSP-compliant. This article focuses on styles compliance. import { setUseLinks, setPackageCSSRoot } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CSP.js&quot;; These functions affect the way the UI5 Web Components framework manages CSS. This is important if you are aiming for CSP-compliance, since in order to be CSP-compliant, in the most general case, a site cannot use &lt;style&gt; tags. Background The UI5 Web Components framework can leverage CSS (for shadow roots and the &lt;head&gt;) in 3 ways: with Constructable StyleSheets (document.adoptedStyleSheets) for the browsers that support them, with &lt;style&gt; tags, and with &lt;link&gt; tags. Way to use CSS Supported by CSP Compliant Extra setup required Constructable Stylesheets (default for Chrome/Edge) Chrome / Edge Yes No &lt;style&gt; (default for Firefox/Safari) all No No &lt;link&gt; (optional for all browsers) all Yes Yes (CSS files must be statically served) In summary, Constructable Stylesheets are both CSP-compliant and require no extra work on your part. Therefore, browsers that can use them (Chrome, Edge) are CSP-compliant out of the box. Firefox and Safari, on the other hand, use &lt;style&gt; tags by default, for both the shadow roots of web components, and in the HTML document’s head, and are therefore not CSP-compliant by default. Turning on CSP Compliance for Firefox and Safari To make UI5 Web Components CSP-compliant also on Firefox and Safari, you need to copy the CSS resources for all relevant UI5 Web Components packages to where you can serve them, and use the setUseLinks and setPackageCSSRoot functions. Example: 1) First, copy the CSS files for all relevant packages to a directory that can be served, in this example, public/css/: cp -r node_modules/@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/css/ public/css/base/ cp -r node_modules/@ui5/webcomponents-theming/dist/css/ public/css/theming/ cp -r node_modules/@ui5/webcomponents/dist/css/ public/css/main/ cp -r node_modules/@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/css/ public/css/fiori/ Note: make these commands part of your build task, if your app needs to be CSP-compliant on all browsers. You will always need the CSS resources of the framework-level packages (@ui5/webcomponents-base and @ui5/webcomponents-theming), and additionally the ones of all components packages your app is going to use (such as @ui5/webcomponents and @ui5/webcomponents-fiori). By convention, the CSS files are found in the dist/css/ directory for each package that ships CSS resources. 2) Call the 2 functions, described above, as follows: import { setPackageCSSRoot, setUseLinks } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CSP.js&quot;; setUseLinks(!document.adoptedStyleSheets); // or &quot;true&quot;, to force all browsers to use links setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base&quot;, &quot;public/css/base/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-theming&quot;, &quot;public/css/theming/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents&quot;, &quot;public/css/main/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori&quot;, &quot;public/css/fiori/&quot;); Calling setUseLinks with !document.adoptedStyleSheets as its argument is an easy way to tell the framework to use &lt;link&gt; tags only for the browsers that don’t support Constructable Stylesheets. However, you can call setUseLinks(true) to make all browsers consume CSS from &lt;link&gt;s, if you prefer so. Then, for each package, call setPackageCSSRoot and pass the directory, from which the CSS files will be served. You can pass relative paths to your HTML page, as in the example above, or fully qualified paths, for example: setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base&quot;, &quot;https://my.site/path/to/public/css/base/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-theming&quot;, &quot;https://my.site/path/to/public/css/theming/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents&quot;, &quot;https://my.site/path/to/public/css/main/&quot;); setPackageCSSRoot(&quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori&quot;, &quot;https://my.site/path/to/public/css/fiori/&quot;); It’s simpler to just use relative paths, if your app is going to have one index.html file, and you can conveniently point to a directory, relative to it. However, in case components will be used in different pages across your site, or you are using URL re-writing, it would be safest to use fully qualified paths. Links Preloading By default, when using &lt;link&gt;s, they are preloaded in the browser’s &lt;head&gt; (even the ones for shadow roots) in order to avoid flashing of un-styled content. These preloads have the form: &lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; as=&quot;style&quot; ...&gt;. If, for any reason, you want to opt out of these preloads, you can do so by calling the setPreloadLinks function: import { setPreloadLinks } from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/CSP.js&quot;; setPreloadLinks(false); Summary By default, the UI5 Web Components framework manages CSS resources either with Constructable Stylesheets, or with &lt;style&gt; tags. Since Constructable Stylesheets are CSP-compliant, UI5 Web Components is CSP-compliant on browsers that support them (Chrome, Edge) out of the box. For the other browsers (Firefox, Safari), in order to achieve CSP-compliance, you must instruct the framework to use &lt;link&gt; instead of &lt;style&gt; tags, but then you must also copy the CSS resources to a directory you can serve them from.",

&lt;section class=&quot;component-description&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt; Displays a group of avatars arranged horizontally. It is useful to visually showcase a group of related avatars, such as, project team members or employees. The component allows you to display the avatars in different sizes, depending on your use case. The AvatarGroup component has two group types: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Group type: The avatars are displayed as partially overlapped on top of each other and the entire group has one click/tap area.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Individual type: The avatars are displayed side-by-side and each avatar has its own click/tap area.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Responsive Behavior When the available space is less than the width required to display all avatars, an overflow visualization appears as a button placed at the end with the same shape and size as the avatars. The visualization displays the number of avatars that have overflowed and are not currently visible. Usage Use the AvatarGroup if: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;You want to display a group of avatars.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You want to display several avatars which have something in common.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Do not use the AvatarGroup if: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;You want to display a single avatar.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You want to display a gallery for simple images.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You want to use it for other visual content than avatars.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Keyboard Handling The component provides advanced keyboard handling. When focused, the user can use the following keyboard shortcuts in order to perform a navigation: - type Individual: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[TAB] - Move focus to the overflow button&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[LEFT] - Navigate one avatar to the left&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[RIGHT] - Navigate one avatar to the right&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[HOME] - Navigate to the first avatar&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[END] - Navigate to the last avatar&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SPACE],[ENTER],[RETURN] - Trigger ui5-click event&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; - type Group: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[TAB] - Move focus to the next interactive element after the component&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SPACE],[ENTER],[RETURN] - Trigger ui5-click event&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; colorScheme (readonly) &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;AvatarColorScheme [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt; [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Returns an array containing the &lt;code&gt;AvatarColorScheme&lt;/code&gt; values that correspond to the avatars in the component. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; hiddenItems (readonly) &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;hidden-items&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;HTMLElement [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt; [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Returns an array containing the &lt;code&gt;ui5-avatar&lt;/code&gt; instances that are currently not displayed due to lack of space. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; type &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;AvatarGroupType&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Group&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the mode of the &lt;code&gt;AvatarGroup&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Available options are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Group&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Individual&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title space-top&quot; &gt;Slots&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt; This Element provides slot(s). This means it can display its child nodes.&lt;br&gt; Unless targeting the default slot, use the &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; attribute to define the destination slot for each child.&lt;br&gt; Text, along with HTML Elements with no &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; attribute, goes the the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; slot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Slot&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;default&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;HTMLElement [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the items of the component. Use the &lt;code&gt;ui5-avatar&lt;/code&gt; component as an item. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The UX guidelines recommends using avatars with &quot;Circle&quot; shape. Moreover, if you use avatars with &quot;Square&quot; shape, there will be visual inconsistency as the built-in overflow action has &quot;Circle&quot; shape.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;overflowButton&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the overflow button of the component. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; We recommend using the &lt;code&gt;ui5-button&lt;/code&gt; component. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; If this slot is not used, the component will display the built-in overflow button.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title space-top&quot;&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;This Web Component fires semantic events upon user interaction. You can bind to these events with the standard DOM APIs, such as &lt;code&gt;addEventListener&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;click&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Fired when the component is activated either with a click/tap or by using the Enter or Space key. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.11&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;tr class=&quot;api-table-event-param&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-event-params-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-param-name api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;targetRef&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-event-param-cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;bold&quot; &gt;type:&lt;/strong&gt; HTMLElement &lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;api-table-event-description bold&quot;&gt;description:&lt;/strong&gt; The DOM ref of the clicked item.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr class=&quot;api-table-event-param&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-event-params-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-param-name api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;overflowButtonClicked&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-event-param-cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;bold&quot; &gt;type:&lt;/strong&gt; boolean &lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;api-table-event-description bold&quot;&gt;description:&lt;/strong&gt; indicates if the overflow button is clicked&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;overflow&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Fired when the count of visible &lt;code&gt;ui5-avatar&lt;/code&gt; elements in the component has changed &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.13&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;footer class=&quot;footer-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footer-links&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;separator&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sap.com/about/legal/privacy.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sap.com/about/legal/impressum.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Legal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;../../../assets/images/sap-logo-svg.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Sap Logo&quot; /&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;",

It serves the purpose to attract the user attention to some piece of information (state, quantity, condition, etc.). Usage Guidelines If the text is longer than the width of the component, it doesn’t wrap, it shows ellipsis. When truncated, the full text is not visible, therefore, it’s recommended to make more space for longer texts to be fully displayed. Colors are not semantic and have no visual representation in High Contrast Black (sap_belize_hcb) theme. ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Badge&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

There are 10 predefined schemes. Each scheme applies different values for the &lt;code&gt;background-color&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;border-color&lt;/code&gt;. To use one you can set a number from &lt;code&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&quot;10&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;colorScheme&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/code&gt; will be set by default. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Color schemes have no visual representation in High Contrast Black (sap_belize_hcb) theme. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title space-top&quot; &gt;Slots&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt; This Element provides slot(s).

The component consists of three areas to hold its content - startContent slot, default slot and endContent slot. It has the capability to center content, such as a title, while having other components on the left and right side. Usage With the use of the design property, you can set the style of the Bar to appear designed like a Header, Subheader, Footer and FloatingFooter. Note: Do not place a Bar inside another Bar or inside any bar-like component. Doing so may cause unpredictable behavior. Responsive Behavior The default slot will be centered in the available space between the startContent and the endContent areas, therefore it might not always be centered in the entire bar. CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. The ui5-bar exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;bar - Used to style the wrapper of the content of the component&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Keyboard Handling Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/Bar.js&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

Opening the dialog launches the device camera and scans for known barcode formats. A scanSuccess event fires whenever a barcode is identified and a scanError event fires when the scan failed (for example, due to missing permisions). Internally, the component uses the zxing-js/library third party OSS. For a list of supported barcode formats, see the zxing-js/library documentation. &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title space-top&quot;&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;This Web Component fires semantic events upon user interaction.

It helps the user to be aware of their location within the application and allows faster navigation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The last three steps can be accessed as links directly, while the remaining links prior to them are available in a drop-down menu. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You can choose the type of separator to be used from a number of predefined options. Keyboard Handling The ui5-breadcrumbs provides advanced keyboard handling. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[F4, ALT+UP, ALT+DOWN, SPACE, ENTER] - If the dropdown arrow is focused - opens/closes the drop-down.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SPACE, ENTER] - Activates the focused item and triggers the item-click event.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[ESC] - Closes the drop-down.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[LEFT] - If the drop-down is closed - navigates one item to the left.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[RIGHT] - If the drop-down is closed - navigates one item to the right.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[UP] - If the drop-down is open - moves focus to the next item.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[DOWN] - If the drop-down is open - moves focus to the previous item.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[HOME] - Navigates to the first item.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[END] - Navigates to the last item.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

It does not block the current UI screen so other operations could be triggered in parallel. It displays 3 dots and each dot expands and shrinks at a different rate, resulting in a cascading flow of animation. Usage For the ui5-busy-indicator you can define the size, the text and whether it is shown or hidden. In order to hide it, use the “active” property. In order to show busy state over an HTML element, simply nest the HTML element in a ui5-busy-indicator instance. Note: Since ui5-busy-indicator has display: inline-block; by default and no width of its own, whenever you need to wrap a block-level element, you should set display: block to the busy indicator as well. When to use: The user needs to be able to cancel the operation. Only part of the application or a particular component is affected. When not to use: The operation takes less than one second. You need to block the screen and prevent the user from starting another activity. Do not show multiple busy indicators at once.

It enables users to trigger actions by clicking or tapping the ui5-button, or by pressing certain keyboard keys, such as Enter. Usage For the ui5-button UI, you can define text, icon, or both. You can also specify whether the text or the icon is displayed first. You can choose from a set of predefined types that offer different styling to correspond to the triggered action. You can set the ui5-button as enabled or disabled. An enabled ui5-button can be pressed by clicking or tapping it. The button changes its style to provide visual feedback to the user that it is pressed or hovered over with the mouse cursor. A disabled ui5-button appears inactive and cannot be pressed. CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. The ui5-button exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;button - Used to style the native button element&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

Currently selected dates are represented with instances of ui5-date as children of the ui5-calendar. The value property of each ui5-date must be a date string, correctly formatted according to the ui5-calendar’s formatPattern property. Whenever the user changes the date selection, ui5-calendar will automatically create/remove instances of ui5-date in itself, unless you prevent this behavior by calling preventDefault() for the selected-dates-change event. This is useful if you want to control the selected dates externally. Usage The user can navigate to a particular date by: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pressing over a month inside the months view&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pressing over an year inside the years view&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; The user can confirm a date selection by pressing over a date inside the days view. Keyboard Handling The ui5-calendar provides advanced keyboard handling. When a picker is showed and focused the user can use the following keyboard shortcuts in order to perform a navigation: - Day picker: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[F4] - Shows month picker&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SHIFT] + [F4] - Shows year picker&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[PAGEUP] - Navigate to the previous month&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[PAGEDOWN] - Navigate to the next month&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SHIFT] + [PAGEUP] - Navigate to the previous year&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SHIFT] + [PAGEDOWN] - Navigate to the next year&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[CTRL] + [SHIFT] + [PAGEUP] - Navigate ten years backwards&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[CTRL] + [SHIFT] + [PAGEDOWN] - Navigate ten years forwards&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[HOME] - Navigate to the first day of the week&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[END] - Navigate to the last day of the week&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[CTRL] + [HOME] - Navigate to the first day of the month&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[CTRL] + [END] - Navigate to the last day of the month&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; - Month picker: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[PAGEUP] - Navigate to the previous year&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[PAGEDOWN] - Navigate to the next year&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[HOME] - Navigate to the first month of the current row&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[END] - Navigate to the last month of the current row&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[CTRL] + [HOME] - Navigate to the first month of the current year&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[CTRL] + [END] - Navigate to the last month of the year&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; - Year picker: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[PAGEUP] - Navigate to the previous year range&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[PAGEDOWN] - Navigate the next year range&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[HOME] - Navigate to the first year of the current row&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[END] - Navigate to the last year of the current row&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[CTRL] + [HOME] - Navigate to the first year of the current year range&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[CTRL] + [END] - Navigate to the last year of the current year range&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; Calendar types The component supports several calendar types - Gregorian, Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese and Persian. By default the Gregorian Calendar is used. In order to use the Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese or Persian calendar, you need to set the primaryCalendarType property and import one or more of the following modules: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Buddhist.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Islamic.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Japanese.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Persian.js&quot;; Or, you can use the global configuration and set the calendarType key: &lt;script data-id=&quot;sap-ui-config&quot; type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt; { &quot;calendarType&quot;: &quot;Japanese&quot; } &lt;/script&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Calendar&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; hideWeekNumbers &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;hide-week-numbers&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the visibility of the week numbers column. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; For calendars other than Gregorian, the week numbers are not displayed regardless of what is set. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; selectionMode &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;selection-mode&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;CalendarSelectionMode&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Single&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the type of selection used in the calendar component.

The ui5-card is a component that represents information in the form of a tile with separate header and content areas. The content area of a ui5-card can be arbitrary HTML content. The header can be used through slot header. For which there is a ui5-card-header component to achieve the card look and fill. Note: We recommend the usage of ui5-card-header for the header slot, so advantage can be taken for keyboard handling, styling and accessibility. CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Card&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/CardHeader.js&quot;; (for ui5-card-header) &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

The component is mostly used for showing a gallery of images, but can hold any other HTML element. &lt;br&gt; There are several ways to perform navigation: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;on desktop - the user can navigate using the navigation arrows or with keyboard shorcuts.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;on mobile - the user can use swipe gestures.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Usage When to use: The items you want to display are very different from each other. You want to display the items one after the other. When not to use: The items you want to display need to be visible at the same time. The items you want to display are uniform and very similar. Keyboard Handling Basic Navigation When the ui5-carousel is focused the user can navigate between the items with the following keyboard shortcuts: Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; [UP/DOWN] - Navigates to previous and next item [LEFT/RIGHT] - Navigates to previous and next item ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Carousel.js&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; arrowsPlacement &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;arrows-placement&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;CarouselArrowsPlacement&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Content&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the position of arrows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Available options are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Navigation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;br&gt; When set to &quot;Content&quot;, the arrows are placed on the sides of the current page. &lt;br&gt; When set to &quot;Navigation&quot;, the arrows are placed on the sides of the page indicator. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; cyclic &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the carousel should loop, i.e show the first page after the last page is reached and vice versa. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; hideNavigationArrows &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;hide-navigation-arrows&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the visibility of the navigation arrows. If set to true the navigation arrows will be hidden. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The navigation arrows are never displayed on touch devices. In this case, the user can swipe to navigate through the items. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.15&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; hidePageIndicator &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;hide-page-indicator&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the visibility of the paging indicator.

The ui5-checkbox component consists of a box and a label that describes its purpose. If it’s checked, an indicator is displayed inside the box. To check/uncheck the ui5-checkbox, the user has to click or tap the square box or its label. The ui5-checkbox component only has 2 states - checked and unchecked. Clicking or tapping toggles the ui5-checkbox between checked and unchecked state. Usage You can define the checkbox text with via the text property. If the text exceeds the available width, it is truncated by default. In case you prefer text to wrap, set the wrappingType property to “Normal”. The touchable area for toggling the ui5-checkbox ends where the text ends. You can disable the ui5-checkbox by setting the disabled property to true, or use the ui5-checkbox in read-only mode by setting the readonly property to true. &lt;h3&gt;Keyboard Handling&lt;/h3&gt; The user can use the following keyboard shortcuts to toggle the checked state of the ui5-checkbox. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SPACE, ENTER] - Toggles between different states: checked, not checked.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/CheckBox&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; For the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; property to have effect, you must add the following import to your project: &lt;code&gt;import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputElementsFormSupport.js&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; When set, a native &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; HTML element will be created inside the component so that it can be submitted as part of an HTML form. Do not use this property unless you need to submit a form. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; readonly &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the component is read-only. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; A red-only component is not editable, but still provides visual feedback upon user interaction. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; required &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the component is required. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.3.0&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; text &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the text of the component. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; valueState &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;value-state&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;ValueState&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;None&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the value state of the component. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Warning&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Error&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;(default)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Success&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Information&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; wrappingType &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;wrapping-type&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;WrappingType&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;None&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the component text wraps when there is not enough space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Available options are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; - The text will be truncated with an ellipsis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; - The text will wrap.

You can display a “More colors…” button that opens an additional color picker for the user to choose specific colors that are not present in the predefined range. Usage The palette is intended for users, who don’t want to check and remember the different values of the colors and spend large amount of time to configure the right color through the color picker. For the ui5-color-palette-popover &lt;h3&gt;ES6 Module Import&lt;/h3&gt; import @ui5/webcomponents/dist/ColorPalettePopover.js&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; defaultColor &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;default-color&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;CSSColor&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the default color of the component. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The default color should be a part of the ColorPalette colors&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; showDefaultColor &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;show-default-color&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the user can choose the default color from a button. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; showMoreColors &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;show-more-colors&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the user can choose a custom color from a component. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; In order to use this property you need to import the following module: &lt;code&gt;&quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/ColorPaletteMoreColors.js&quot;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; showRecentColors &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;show-recent-colors&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the user can see the last used colors in the bottom of the component &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title space-top&quot; &gt;Slots&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt; This Element provides slot(s).

It is commonly used to enable users to select an option from a predefined list. Structure The ui5-combobox consists of the following elements: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Input field - displays the selected option or a custom user entry. Users can type to narrow down the list or enter their own value. &lt;li&gt; Drop-down arrow - expands collapses the option list.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Option list - the list of available options.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Keyboard Handling The ui5-combobox provides advanced keyboard handling. [F4], [ALT]+[UP], or [ALT]+[DOWN] - Toggles the picker. [ESC] - Closes the picker, if open. If closed, cancels changes and reverts the typed in value. [ENTER] or [RETURN] - If picker is open, takes over the currently selected item and closes it. [DOWN] - Selects the next matching item in the picker. [UP] - Selects the previous matching item in the picker. [PAGEDOWN] - Moves selection down by page size (10 items by default). [PAGEUP] - Moves selection up by page size (10 items by default). [HOME] - If focus is in the ComboBox, moves cursor at the beginning of text. If focus is in the picker, selects the first item. [END] - If focus is in the ComboBox, moves cursor at the end of text. If focus is in the picker, selects the last item.

The ui5-date-picker allows users to select a localized date using touch, mouse, or keyboard input. It consists of two parts: the date input field and the date picker. Usage The user can enter a date by: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Using the calendar that opens in a popup&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Typing it in directly in the input field&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; When the user makes an entry and presses the enter key, the calendar shows the corresponding date. When the user directly triggers the calendar display, the actual date is displayed. Formatting If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format. Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. For more information, see UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup Language. For example, if the format-pattern is “yyyy-MM-dd”, a valid value string is “2015-07-30” and the same is displayed in the input. Keyboard Handling The ui5-date-picker provides advanced keyboard handling. If the ui5-date-picker is focused, you can open or close the drop-down by pressing F4, ALT+UP or ALT+DOWN keys. Once the drop-down is opened, you can use the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrow keys to navigate through the dates and select one by pressing the Space or Enter keys. Moreover you can use TAB to reach the buttons for changing month and year. If the ui5-date-picker input field is focused and its corresponding picker dialog is not opened, then users can increment or decrement the date referenced by dateValue property by using the following shortcuts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[PAGEDOWN] - Decrements the corresponding day of the month by one&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SHIFT] + [PAGEDOWN] - Decrements the corresponding month by one&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SHIFT] + [CTRL] + [PAGEDOWN] - Decrements the corresponding year by one&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[PAGEUP] - Increments the corresponding day of the month by one&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SHIFT] + [PAGEUP] - Increments the corresponding month by one&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SHIFT] + [CTRL] + [PAGEUP] - Increments the corresponding year by one&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Calendar types The component supports several calendar types - Gregorian, Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese and Persian. By default the Gregorian Calendar is used. In order to use the Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese or Persian calendar, you need to set the primaryCalendarType property and import one or more of the following modules: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Buddhist.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Islamic.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Japanese.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Persian.js&quot;; Or, you can use the global configuration and set the calendarType key: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;script data-id=&quot;sap-ui-config&quot; type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt; { &quot;calendarType&quot;: &quot;Japanese&quot; } &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/DatePicker&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleName &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-name&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the aria-label attribute for the component. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.15&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleNameRef &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-name-ref&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Receives id(or many ids) of the elements that label the component. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.15&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; dateValue (readonly) &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;date-value&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Currently selected date represented as a Local JavaScript Date instance. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; disabled &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Determines whether the component is displayed as disabled. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; hideWeekNumbers &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;hide-week-numbers&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the visibility of the week numbers column. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; For calendars other than Gregorian, the week numbers are not displayed regardless of what is set. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.8&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; name &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Determines the name with which the component will be submitted in an HTML form. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; For the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; property to have effect, you must add the following import to your project: &lt;code&gt;import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputElementsFormSupport.js&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; When set, a native &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; HTML element will be created inside the component so that it can be submitted as part of an HTML form. Do not use this property unless you need to submit a form. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; placeholder &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines a short hint, intended to aid the user with data entry when the component has no value. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; When no placeholder is set, the format pattern is displayed as a placeholder. Passing an empty string as the value of this property will make the component appear empty - without placeholder or format pattern. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; readonly &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt;

Usage Use the DateTimePicker if you need a combined date and time input component. Don&#39;t use it if you want to use either date, or time value. In this case, use the DatePicker or the TimePicker components instead. The user can set date/time by: using the calendar and the time selectors typing in the input field Programatically, to set date/time for the DateTimePicker, use the value property Formatting The value entered by typing into the input field must fit to the used date/time format. Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. For more information, see UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup Language. Example: the following format dd/MM/yyyy, hh:mm:ss aa corresponds the 13/04/2020, 03:16:16 AM value. The small &#39;h&#39; defines &quot;12&quot; hours format and the &quot;aa&quot; symbols - &quot;AM/PM&quot; time periods. Example: the following format dd/MM/yyyy, HH:mm:ss corresponds the 13/04/2020, 15:16:16 value. The capital &#39;H&#39; indicates &quot;24&quot; hours format. Note: If the formatPattern does NOT include time, the DateTimePicker will fallback to the default time format according to the locale. Note: If no placeholder is set to the DateTimePicker, the current formatPattern is displayed as a placeholder. If another placeholder is needed, it must be set or in case no placeholder is needed - it can be set to an empty string. Note: If the user input does NOT match the formatPattern, the DateTimePicker makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale settings. Responsive behavior The DateTimePicker is responsive and fully adapts to all devices. For larger screens, such as tablet or desktop, it is displayed as a popover, while on phone devices, it is displayed full screen. ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/DateTimePicker.js&quot;; Properties/Attributes You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different. Name Type Default Value Description accessibleName accessible-name string Defines the aria-label attribute for the component. since v1.0.0-rc.15 accessibleNameRef accessible-name-ref string &quot;&quot; Receives id(or many ids) of the elements that label the component. since v1.0.0-rc.15 dateValue (readonly) date-value Date Currently selected date represented as a Local JavaScript Date instance. disabled boolean false Determines whether the component is displayed as disabled. hideWeekNumbers hide-week-numbers boolean false Defines the visibility of the week numbers column. Note: For calendars other than Gregorian, the week numbers are not displayed regardless of what is set. since v1.0.0-rc.8 name string &quot;&quot; Determines the name with which the component will be submitted in an HTML form. Important: For the name property to have effect, you must add the following import to your project: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputElementsFormSupport.js&quot;; Note: When set, a native input HTML element will be created inside the component so that it can be submitted as part of an HTML form. Do not use this property unless you need to submit a form. placeholder string undefined Defines a short hint, intended to aid the user with data entry when the component has no value. Note: When no placeholder is set, the format pattern is displayed as a placeholder. Passing an empty string as the value of this property will make the component appear empty - without placeholder or format pattern. readonly boolean false Determines whether the component is displayed as read-only. required boolean false Defines whether the component is required. since v1.0.0-rc.9 value string &quot;&quot; Defines a formatted date value. valueState value-state ValueState &quot;None&quot; Defines the value state of the component. Available options are: None Error Warning Success Information formatPattern format-pattern string &quot;&quot; Determines the format, displayed in the input field. maxDate max-date string &quot;&quot; Determines the maximum date available for selection. since v1.0.0-rc.6 minDate min-date string &quot;&quot; Determines the minimum date available for selection. since v1.0.0-rc.6 primaryCalendarType primary-calendar-type CalendarType Sets a calendar type used for display. If not set, the calendar type of the global configuration is used. secondaryCalendarType secondary-calendar-type CalendarType undefined Defines the secondary calendar type. If not set, the calendar will only show the primary calendar type. since v1.0.0-rc.16 Slots This Element provides slot(s). This means it can display its child nodes. Unless targeting the default slot, use the slot attribute to define the destination slot for each child. Text, along with HTML Elements with no slot attribute, goes the the default slot. Slot Type Description valueStateMessage HTMLElement Defines the value state message that will be displayed as pop up under the component. Note: If not specified, a default text (in the respective language) will be displayed. Note: The valueStateMessage would be displayed, when the component is in Information, Warning or Error value state. Events This Web Component fires semantic events upon user interaction. You can bind to these events with the standard DOM APIs, such as addEventListener. Name Description change Fired when the input operation has finished by pressing Enter or on focusout. value type: string description: The submitted value. valid type: boolean description: Indicator if the value is in correct format pattern and in valid range. input Fired when the value of the component is changed at each key stroke. value type: string description: The submitted value. valid type: boolean description: Indicator if the value is in correct format pattern and in valid range. Methods This Web Component exposes public methods. You can invoke them directly on the Web Component instance. Name Description openPicker Opens the picker. closePicker Closes the picker. formatValue Formats a Java Script date object into a string representing a locale date according to the formatPattern property of the DatePicker instance date type: object description: A Java Script date object to be formatted as string isInValidRange Checks if a date is between the minimum and maximum date. value type: string description: A value to be checked isOpen Checks if the picker is open. isValid Checks if a value is valid against the current date format of the DatePicker. value type: string description: A value to be tested against the current date format Privacy Policy Legal",

It is used to prompt the user for an action or a confirmation. The &lt;code&gt;ui5-dialog&lt;/code&gt; interrupts the current app processing as it is the only focused UI element and the main screen is dimmed/blocked. The dialog combines concepts known from other technologies where the windows have names such as dialog box, dialog window, pop-up, pop-up window, alert box, or message box. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The &lt;code&gt;ui5-dialog&lt;/code&gt; is modal, which means that user action is required before returning to the parent window is possible. The content of the &lt;code&gt;ui5-dialog&lt;/code&gt; is fully customizable. Structure A ui5-dialog consists of a header, content, and a footer for action buttons. The ui5-dialog is usually displayed at the center of the screen. Its position can be changed by the user. To enable this, you need to set the property draggable accordingly. Responsive Behavior The stretch property can be used to stretch the ui5-dialog on full screen. CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. The ui5-dialog exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;header - Used to style the header of the component&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;content - Used to style the content of the component&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;footer - Used to style the footer of the component&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Dialog&quot;; Note: We don’t recommend nesting popup-like components (ui5-dialog, ui5-popover) inside ui5-dialog. Ideally you should create all popups on the same level inside your HTML page and just open them from one another, rather than nesting them. Note: We don’t recommend nesting popup-like components (ui5-dialog, ui5-popover) inside other components containing z-index. This might break z-index management. &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

If this property is set to true, the Dialog will have a resize handle in its bottom right corner in LTR languages. In RTL languages, the resize handle will be placed in the bottom left corner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The component can be resizable only in desktop mode. &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Upon resizing, externally defined height and width styling will be ignored. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.10&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; stretch &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Determines whether the component should be stretched to fullscreen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The component will be stretched to approximately 90% of the viewport. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleName &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-name&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the accessible name of the component. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.15&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleNameRef &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-name-ref&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the IDs of the elements that label the component. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.1.0&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; initialFocus &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;initial-focus&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the ID of the HTML Element, which will get the initial focus. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; open &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Indicates if the element is open &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.2.0&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; preventFocusRestore &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;prevent-focus-restore&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines if the focus should be returned to the previously focused element, when the popup closes. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.8&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title space-top&quot; &gt;Slots&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt; This Element provides slot(s).

The side content appears in a container next to or directly below the main content (it doesn’t overlay). When the side content is triggered, the main content becomes narrower (if appearing side-by-side). The side content contains a separate scrollbar when appearing next to the main content. Usage When to use? Use this component if you want to display relevant information that is not critical for users to complete a task. Users should have access to all the key functions and critical information in the app even if they do not see the side content. This is important because on smaller screen sizes it may be difficult to display the side content in a way that is easily accessible for the user. When not to use? Don’t use it if you want to display navigation or critical information that prevents users from completing a task when they have no access to the side content. Responsive Behavior Screen width &gt; 1440px Main vs. side content ratio is 75 vs. 25 percent (with a minimum of 320px each). If the application defines a trigger, the side content can be hidden. Screen width &lt;= 1440px and &gt; 1024px Main vs. side content ratio is 66.666 vs. 33.333 percent (with a minimum of 320px each). If the side content width falls below 320 px, it automatically slides under the main content, unless the app development team specifies that it should disappear. Screen width &lt;= 1024px and &gt; 720px The side content ratio is fixed to 340px, and the main content takes the rest of the width. Only if the sideContentFallDown is set to OnMinimumWidth and screen width is &lt;= 960px and &gt; 720px the side content falls below the main content. Screen width &lt;= 720px (for example on a mobile device) In this case, the side content automatically disappears from the screen (unless specified to stay under the content by setting of sideContentVisibility property to AlwaysShow) and can be triggered from a pre-set trigger (specified within the app). When the side content is triggered, it replaces the main content. We recommend that you always place the trigger for the side content in the same location, such as in the app footer. A special case allows switching the comparison mode between the main and side content. In this case, the screen is split into 50:50 percent for main vs. side content. The responsive behavior of the equal split is the same as in the standard view - the side content disappears on screen widths of less than 720 px and can only be viewed by triggering it.

    "content": "Frequently Asked Questions Q: How can I play with UI5 Web Components easily? A: Use this CodeSandBox. Q: Where is the documentation? A: There are several resources: Web Components APIs How to get started? Q: Is there a CDN to load UI5 Web Components from? A: No. The best practice is to build your own bundle. See this article for details. Q: Are UI5 Web Components APIs stable? A: Mostly yes since the project is in Release Candidate state, but minor changes may still be expected until the official release. Q: Can I create my own UI5 Web Components? A: Yes, for more information see Creating a Custom UI5 Web Components Package Q: How big is the runtime? A: Currently on main, a simple working Web Component (ui5-label) and its dependencies equals to around 22K gzipped. Two simple web components (ui5-label and ui5-icon) and their dependencies equal to around 25K gzipped. Note: The quoted numbers include only a &lt;ui5-label&gt; (respectively ui5-label and ui5-icon) working on Chrome/FF/Safari with the default settings (theme/language). Additional features, settings and old browser support will increase bundle size accordingly. Q: What is the difference between UI5 Web Components and OpenUI5? A: See the project’s readme.md for more on this. Q: Can I use UI5 Web Components in an OpenUI5 application? A: This is not necessary as OpenUI5 already provides equivalents in the form of UI5 Controls. Q: How can I hide not yet upgraded Web Components so that users don’t see them until styled? A: You can place a CSS rule such as: *:not(:defined) { display: none; } or: *:not(:defined) { visibility: hidden; } in your application, depending on your preference. The selector *:not(:defined) will match all web components that haven’t been defined yet. Alternatively, you could only apply this rule for selected web components: ui5-button:not(:defined), ui5-label:not(:defined) { display: none; } Please note that the :defined CSS pseudo-selector is not supported by the Edge and Internet Explorer 11 browsers.",

The component consists of input field, but you can provide an HTML element by your choice to trigger the file upload, by using the default slot. Furthermore, you can set the property “hideInput” to “true” to hide the input field. To get all selected files, you can simply use the read-only “files” property. To restrict the types of files the user can select, you can use the “accept” property. And, similar to all input based components, the FileUploader supports “valueState”, “placeholder”, “name”, and “disabled” properties.

There are several possible layouts that can be changed either with the component API, or by pressing the arrows, displayed between the columns. Usage Use this component for applications that need to display several logical levels of related information side by side (e.g. list of items, item, sub-item, etc.). The Component is flexible in a sense that the application can focus the user’s attention on one particular column. Responsive Behavior The FlexibleColumnLayout automatically displays the maximum possible number of columns based on layout property and the window size. The component would display 1 column for window size smaller than 599px, up to two columns between 599px and 1023px, and 3 columns for sizes bigger than 1023px. &lt;h3&gt;Keyboard Handling&lt;/h3&gt; Basic Navigation [SPACE, ENTER, RETURN] - If focus is on the layout toggle button (arrow button), once activated, it triggers the associated action (such as expand/collapse the column). This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up.

Available options are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;OneColumn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TwoColumnsStartExpanded&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TwoColumnsMidExpanded&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;For example:&lt;/b&gt; layout=&lt;code&gt;TwoColumnsStartExpanded&lt;/code&gt; means the layout will display up to two columns in 67%/33% proportion. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; midColumnVisible (readonly) &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;mid-column-visible&lt;/code&gt;

There are two main scenarios how the ui5-icon component is used: as a purely decorative element, or as an interactive element that can be focused and clicked. Usage Get familiar with the icons collections. Before displaying an icon, you need to explore the icons collections to find and import the desired icon. Currently there are 3 icons collection, available as 3 npm packages: @ui5/webcomponents-icons represents the &quot;SAP-icons&quot; collection and includes the following icons. @ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt represents the &quot;tnt&quot; collection and includes the following icons. @ui5/webcomponents-icons-icons-business-suite represents the &quot;business-suite&quot; collection and includes the following icons. After exploring the icons collections, add one or more of the packages as dependencies to your project. npm i @ui5/webcomponents-icons npm i @ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt npm i @ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite Then, import the desired icon. import &quot;@ui5/{package_name}/dist/{icon_name}.js&quot;; For Example: For the standard “SAP-icons” icon collection, import an icon from the @ui5/webcomponents-icons package: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/employee.js&quot;; For the “tnt” (SAP Fiori Tools) icon collection, import an icon from the @ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt package: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt/dist/antenna.js&quot;; For the “business-suite” (SAP Business Suite) icon collection, import an icon from the @ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite package: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite/dist/ab-testing.js&quot;; Display the icon using the ui5-icon web component. Set the icon collection (“SAP-icons”, “tnt” or “business-suite” - “SAP-icons” is the default icon collection and can be skipped) and the icon name to the name property. &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;employee&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-icon&gt; &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;tnt/antenna&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-icon&gt; &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;business-suite/ab-testing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-icon&gt; Keyboard Handling [SPACE, ENTER, RETURN] - Fires the click event if the interactive property is set to true. [SHIFT] - If [SPACE] or [ENTER],[RETURN] is pressed, pressing [SHIFT] releases the ui5-icon without triggering the click event.

Each illustration has default internationalised title and subtitle texts. Also they can be managed with titleText and subtitleText properties. To display the desired illustration, use the name property, where you can find the list of all available illustrations. Note: By default the “BeforeSearch” illustration is loaded. To use other illustrations, make sure you import them in addition, for example: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/illustrations/NoData.js&quot; Note: Illustrations starting with the “Tnt” prefix are part of another illustration set. For example to use the “TntSuccess” illustration, add the following import:: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/illustrations/tnt/Success.js&quot; Structure The IllustratedMessage consists of the following elements, which are displayed below each other in the following order: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Illustration&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Title&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Subtitle&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Actions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Usage ui5-illustrated-message is meant to be used inside container component, for example a ui5-card, a ui5-dialog or a ui5-page ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/IllustratedMessage.js&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

Additionally, you can provide suggestionItems, that are displayed in a popover right under the input. The text field can be editable or read-only (readonly property), and it can be enabled or disabled (disabled property). To visualize semantic states, such as &quot;error&quot; or &quot;warning&quot;, the valueState property is provided. When the user makes changes to the text, the change event is fired, which enables you to react on any text change. Note: If you are using the ui5-input as a single npm module, don&#39;t forget to import the InputSuggestions module from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputSuggestions.js&quot; to enable the suggestions functionality. Keyboard Handling The ui5-input provides the following keyboard shortcuts: [ESC] - Closes the suggestion list, if open. If closed or not enabled, cancels changes and reverts to the value which the Input field had when it got the focus. [ENTER] or [RETURN] - If suggestion list is open takes over the current matching item and closes it. If value state or group header is focused, does nothing. [DOWN] - Focuses the next matching item in the suggestion list. [UP] - Focuses the previous matching item in the suggestion list. [HOME] - If focus is in the text input, moves caret before the first character. If focus is in the list, highlights the first item and updates the input accordingly. [END] - If focus is in the text input, moves caret after the last character. If focus is in the list, highlights the last item and updates the input accordingly. [PAGEUP] - If focus is in the list, moves highlight up by page size (10 items by default). If focus is in the input, does nothing. [PAGEDOWN] - If focus is in the list, moves highlight down by page size (10 items by default). If focus is in the input, does nothing. ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Input.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputSuggestions.js&quot;; (optional - for input suggestions support) Properties/Attributes You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different. Name Type Default Value Description accessibleName accessible-name string Defines the accessible aria name of the component. since v1.0.0-rc.15 accessibleNameRef accessible-name-ref string &quot;&quot; Receives id(or many ids) of the elements that label the input. since v1.0.0-rc.15 disabled boolean false Defines whether the component is in disabled state. Note: A disabled component is completely noninteractive. maxlength Integer Sets the maximum number of characters available in the input field. Note: This property is not compatible with the ui5-input type InputType.Number. If the ui5-input type is set to Number, the maxlength value is ignored. since v1.0.0-rc.5 name string &quot;&quot; Determines the name with which the component will be submitted in an HTML form. Important: For the name property to have effect, you must add the following import to your project: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputElementsFormSupport.js&quot;; Note: When set, a native input HTML element will be created inside the component so that it can be submitted as part of an HTML form. Do not use this property unless you need to submit a form. noTypeahead no-typeahead boolean false Defines whether the value will be autcompleted to match an item since v1.4.0 placeholder string &quot;&quot; Defines a short hint intended to aid the user with data entry when the component has no value. previewItem (readonly) preview-item sap.ui.webcomponents.main.IInputSuggestionItem The suggestion item on preview. readonly boolean false Defines whether the component is read-only. Note: A read-only component is not editable, but still provides visual feedback upon user interaction. required boolean false Defines whether the component is required. since v1.0.0-rc.3 showClearIcon show-clear-icon boolean false Defines whether the clear icon of the input will be shown. since v1.2.0 showSuggestions show-suggestions boolean false Defines whether the component should show suggestions, if such are present. Note: You need to import the InputSuggestions module from &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputSuggestions.js&quot; to enable this functionality. type InputType &quot;Text&quot; Defines the HTML type of the component. Available options are: Text, Email, Number, Password, Tel, and URL. Notes: The particular effect of this property differs depending on the browser and the current language settings, especially for type Number. The property is mostly intended to be used with touch devices that use different soft keyboard layouts depending on the given input type. value string &quot;&quot; Defines the value of the component. Note: The property is updated upon typing. valueState value-state ValueState &quot;None&quot; Defines the value state of the component. Available options are: None Error Warning Success Information Slots This Element provides slot(s). This means it can display its child nodes. Unless targeting the default slot, use the slot attribute to define the destination slot for each child. Text, along with HTML Elements with no slot attribute, goes the the default slot. Slot Type Description default HTMLElement [0..n] Defines the suggestion items. Example: &lt;ui5-input show-suggestions&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ui5-suggestion-item text=&quot;Item #1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-suggestion-item&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ui5-suggestion-item text=&quot;Item #2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-suggestion-item&gt; &lt;/ui5-input&gt; Note: The suggestions would be displayed only if the showSuggestions property is set to true. Note: The &lt;ui5-suggestion-item&gt; and &lt;ui5-suggestion-group-item&gt; are recommended to be used as suggestion items. Note: Importing the Input Suggestions Support feature: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputSuggestions.js&quot;; automatically imports the &lt;ui5-suggestion-item&gt; and &lt;ui5-suggestion-group-item&gt; for your convenience. icon HTMLElement [0..n] Defines the icon to be displayed in the component. valueStateMessage HTMLElement [0..n] Defines the value state message that will be displayed as pop up under the component. Note: If not specified, a default text (in the respective language) will be displayed. Note: The valueStateMessage would be displayed, when the component is in Information, Warning or Error value state. Note: If the component has suggestionItems, the valueStateMessage would be displayed as part of the same popover, if used on desktop, or dialog - on phone. Events This Web Component fires semantic events upon user interaction. You can bind to these events with the standard DOM APIs, such as addEventListener. Name Description change Fired when the input operation has finished by pressing Enter or on focusout. input Fired when the value of the component changes at each keystroke, and when a suggestion item has been selected. suggestion-item-preview Fired when the user navigates to a suggestion item via the ARROW keys, as a preview, before the final selection. since v1.0.0-rc.8 item type: HTMLElement description: The previewed suggestion item. targetRef type: HTMLElement description: The DOM ref of the suggestion item. suggestion-item-select Fired when a suggestion item, that is displayed in the suggestion popup, is selected. item type: HTMLElement description: The selected item. Methods This Web Component exposes public methods. You can invoke them directly on the Web Component instance. Name Description openPicker Manually opens the suggestions popover, assuming suggestions are enabled. Items must be preloaded for it to open. SuggestionItem The ui5-suggestion-item represents the suggestion item of the ui5-input. Properties/Attributes You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different. Name Type Default Value Description additionalText additional-text string Defines the additionalText, displayed in the end of the item. since v1.0.0-rc.15 additionalTextState additional-text-state ValueState &quot;None&quot; Defines the state of the additionalText. Available options are: &quot;None&quot; (by default), &quot;Success&quot;, &quot;Information&quot;, &quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Erorr&quot;. since v1.0.0-rc.15 description string Defines the description displayed right under the item text, if such is present. icon string Defines the icon source URI. Note: SAP-icons font provides numerous built-in icons.

Usually it is placed next to a value holder, such as a text field. It informs the user about what data is displayed or expected in the value holder. The ui5-label appearance can be influenced by properties, such as required and wrappingType. The appearance of the Label can be configured in a limited way by using the design property. For a broader choice of designs, you can use custom styles. ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Label&quot;; Properties/Attributes You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different. Name Type Default Value Description for string &quot;&quot; Defines the labeled input by providing its ID. Note: Can be used with both ui5-input and native input. required boolean false Defines whether an asterisk character is added to the component text. Note: Usually indicates that user input is required. showColon show-colon boolean false Defines whether colon is added to the component text. Note: Usually used in forms. wrappingType wrapping-type WrappingType &quot;None&quot; Defines how the text of a component will be displayed when there is not enough space. Available options are: None - The text will be truncated with an ellipsis. Normal - The text will wrap. The words will not be broken based on hyphenation. Slots This Element provides slot(s). This means it can display its child nodes. Unless targeting the default slot, use the slot attribute to define the destination slot for each child. Text, along with HTML Elements with no slot attribute, goes the the default slot. Slot Type Description default Node [0..n] Defines the text of the component. Note: Although this slot accepts HTML Elements, it is strongly recommended that you only use text in order to preserve the intended design. Privacy Policy Legal",

It is a clickable text element, visualized in such a way that it stands out from the standard text. On hover, it changes its style to an underlined text to provide additional feedback to the user. Usage You can set the ui5-link to be enabled or disabled. To create a visual hierarchy in large lists of links, you can set the less important links as Subtle or the more important ones as Emphasized, by using the design property. If the href property is set, the link behaves as the HTML anchor tag (&lt;a&gt;&lt;a&#47;&gt;) and opens the specified URL in the given target frame (target property). To specify where the linked content is opened, you can use the target property. Responsive behavior If there is not enough space, the text of the ui5-link becomes truncated. If the wrappingType property is set to &quot;Normal&quot;, the text is displayed on several lines instead of being truncated.

&lt;div class=&quot;api-container&quot;&gt; &lt;section class=&quot;component-description&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt; The ui5-list component allows displaying a list of items, advanced keyboard handling support for navigating between items, and predefined modes to improve the development efficiency. The ui5-list is a container for the available list items: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;ui5-li&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ui5-li-custom&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ui5-li-groupheader&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; To benefit from the built-in selection mechanism, you can use the available selection modes, such as SingleSelect, MultiSelect and Delete. Additionally, the ui5-list provides header, footer, and customization for the list item separators. &lt;h3&gt;Keyboard Handling&lt;/h3&gt; Basic Navigation The ui5-list provides advanced keyboard handling. When a list is focused the user can use the following keyboard shortcuts in order to perform a navigation: [UP/DOWN] - Navigates up and down the items [HOME] - Navigates to first item [END] - Navigates to the last item The user can use the following keyboard shortcuts to perform actions (such as select, delete), when the mode property is in use: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SPACE] - Select an item (if type is ‘Active’) when mode is selection&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[DELETE] - Delete an item if mode property is Delete&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/List.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/StandardListItem.js&quot;; (for ui5-li) import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/CustomListItem.js&quot;; (for ui5-li-custom) import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/GroupHeaderListItem.js&quot;; (for ui5-li-groupheader) &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleName &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-name&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the accessible name of the component. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.15&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleNameRef &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-name-ref&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the IDs of the elements that label the input. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.15&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleRole &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-role&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;list&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the accessible role of the component. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.15&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; busy &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines if the component would display a loading indicator over the list. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.6&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; busyDelay &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;busy-delay&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the delay in milliseconds, after which the busy indicator will show up for this component. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; footerText &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;footer-text&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the footer text. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; growing &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;ListGrowingMode&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;None&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the component will have growing capability either by pressing a &lt;code&gt;More&lt;/code&gt; button, or via user scroll.

Currently, the supported items are images and videos. The items should be defined using the ui5-media-gallery-item component. The items are initially displayed as thumbnails. When the user selects a thumbnail, the corresponding item is displayed in larger size. The component is responsive by default and adjusts the position of the menu with respect to viewport size, but the application is able to further customize the layout via the provided API. Keyboard Handling The ui5-media-gallery provides advanced keyboard handling. When the thumbnails menu is focused the following keyboard shortcuts allow the user to navigate through the thumbnail items: [UP/DOWN] - Navigates up and down the items [HOME] - Navigates to first item [END] - Navigates to the last item [SPACE/ENTER] - Select an item &lt;/ul&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/MediaGallery&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/MediaGalleryItem&quot;; Properties/Attributes You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different. Name Type Default Value Description interactiveDisplayArea interactive-display-area boolean false If enabled, a display-area-click event is fired when the user clicks or taps on the display area. The display area is the central area that contains the enlarged content of the currently selected item. layout MediaGalleryLayout &quot;Auto&quot; Determines the layout of the component. Available options are: Auto Vertical Horizontal menuHorizontalAlign menu-horizontal-align MediaGalleryMenuHorizontalAlign &quot;Left&quot; Determines the horizontal alignment of the thumbnails menu vs. the central display area.

Available options are: Top Bottom showAllThumbnails show-all-thumbnails boolean false If set to true, all thumbnails are rendered in a scrollable container. If false, only up to five thumbnails are rendered, followed by an overflow button that shows the count of the remaining thumbnails. Slots This Element provides slot(s). This means it can display its child nodes. Unless targeting the default slot, use the slot attribute to define the destination slot for each child. Text, along with HTML Elements with no slot attribute, goes the the default slot. Slot Type Description default HTMLElement [0..n] Defines the component items. Note: Only one selected item is allowed. Note: Use the ui5-media-gallery-item component to define the desired items. Events This Web Component fires semantic events upon user interaction. You can bind to these events with the standard DOM APIs, such as addEventListener. Name Description display-area-click Fired when the display area is clicked. The display area is the central area that contains the enlarged content of the currently selected item. overflow-click Fired when the thumbnails overflow button is clicked. selection-change Fired when selection is changed by user interaction. item type: HTMLElement description: the selected item. &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; MediaGalleryItem Overview The ui5-media-gallery-item web component represents the items displayed in the ui5-media-gallery web component.

An arbitrary hierarchy structure can be represented by recursively nesting menu items. Usage ui5-menu-item is an abstract element, representing a node in a ui5-menu. The menu itself is rendered as a list, and each ui5-menu-item is represented by a list item (ui5-li) in that list. Therefore, you should only use ui5-menu-item directly in your apps. The ui5-li list item is internal for the list, and not intended for public use.

Usage For the ui5-message-strip component, you can define whether it displays an icon in the beginning and a close button. Moreover, its size and background can be controlled with CSS. Keyboard Handling Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up.

This means it can display its child nodes.&lt;br&gt; Unless targeting the default slot, use the &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; attribute to define the destination slot for each child.&lt;br&gt; Text, along with HTML Elements with no &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; attribute, goes the the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; slot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Slot&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;default&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;Node [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the text of the component. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Although this slot accepts HTML Elements, it is strongly recommended that you only use text in order to preserve the intended design.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;icon&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the content to be displayed as graphical element within the component. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; If no icon is given, the default icon for the component type will be used.

The drop-down list is used for selecting and filtering values, it enables users to select one or more options from a predefined list. The control provides an editable input field to filter the list, and a dropdown arrow to expand/collapse the list of available options. The options in the list have checkboxes that permit multi-selection. Entered values are displayed as tokens. &lt;h3&gt;Structure&lt;/h3&gt; The ui5-multi-combobox consists of the following elements: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Tokenizer - a list of tokens with selected options. &lt;li&gt; Input field - displays the selected option/s as token/s. Users can type to filter the list. &lt;li&gt; Drop-down arrow - expands collapses the option list.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Option list - the list of available options.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Keyboard Handling&lt;/h3&gt; The ui5-multi-combobox provides advanced keyboard handling. Picker If the ui5-multi-combobox is focused, you can open or close the drop-down by pressing F4, ALT+UP or ALT+DOWN keys. Once the drop-down is opened, you can use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to navigate through the available options and select one by pressing the Space or Enter keys. Tokens Left/Right arrow keys - moves the focus selection form the currently focused token to the previous/next one (if available). Delete - deletes the token and focuses the previous token. Backspace - deletes the token and focus the next token. CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. The ui5-multi-combobox exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;token-{index} - Used to style each token(where token-0 corresponds to the first item)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/MultiComboBox&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

The user can: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;display a Close button&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;can control whether the titleText and description should wrap or truncate and display a ShowMore button to switch between less and more information&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;add custom actions by using the ui5-notification-action component&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Usage The component can be used in a standard ui5-list. CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. The ui5-li-notification exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;title-text - Used to style the titleText of the notification list item&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/NotificationListItem.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/NotificationAction.js&quot;; (optional) &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

This means it can display its child nodes.&lt;br&gt; Unless targeting the default slot, use the &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; attribute to define the destination slot for each child.&lt;br&gt; Text, along with HTML Elements with no &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; attribute, goes the the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; slot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Slot&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;avatar&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the avatar, displayed in the &lt;code&gt;ui5-li-notification&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Consider using the &lt;code&gt;ui5-avatar&lt;/code&gt; to display icons, initials or images. &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;In order to be complaint with the UX guidlines and for best experience, we recommend using avatars with 2rem X 2rem in size (32px X 32px). In case you are using the &lt;code&gt;ui5-avatar&lt;/code&gt; you can set its &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; property to &lt;code&gt;XS&lt;/code&gt; to get the required size - &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ui5-avatar size=&quot;XS&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ui5-avatar&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;default&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;Node [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the content of the &lt;code&gt;ui5-li-notification&lt;/code&gt;, usually a description of the notification. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Although this slot accepts HTML Elements, it is strongly recommended that you only use text in order to preserve the intended design.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;footnotes&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;HTMLElement [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the elements, displayed in the footer of the of the component.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;actions&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;HTMLElement [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the actions, displayed in the top-right area. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; use the &lt;code&gt;ui5-notification-action&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title space-top&quot;&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;This Web Component fires semantic events upon user interaction.

The page has three distinct areas that can hold content - a header, content area and a footer. &lt;h3&gt;Structure&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Header&lt;/h4&gt; The top most area of the page is occupied by the header. The standard header includes a navigation button and a title. &lt;h4&gt;Content&lt;/h4&gt; The content occupies the main part of the page. Only the content area is scrollable by default. This can be prevented by setting enableScrolling to false. &lt;h4&gt;Footer&lt;/h4&gt; The footer is optional and occupies the fixed bottom part of the page. Alternatively, the footer can be floating above the bottom part of the content. This is enabled with the floatingFooter property. Note: ui5-page occipues the whole available space of its parent. In order to achieve the intended design you have to make sure that there is enough space for the ui5-page to be rendered. ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/Page.js&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; backgroundDesign &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;background-design&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;PageBackgroundDesign&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Solid&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the background color of the &lt;code&gt;ui5-page&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; When a ui5-list is placed inside the page, we recommend using “List” to ensure better color contrast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Available options are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Solid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; (default) &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Transparent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; disableScrolling &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;disable-scrolling&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Disables vertical scrolling of page content.

It can be collapsed to save space on the screen. Guidelines: Nesting two or more panels is not recommended. Do not stack too many panels on one page. Structure The panel’s header area consists of a title bar with a header text or custom header. The header is clickable and can be used to toggle between the expanded and collapsed state. It includes an icon which rotates depending on the state. The custom header can be set through the header slot and it may contain arbitraray content, such as: title, buttons or any other HTML elements. The content area can contain an arbitrary set of controls. Note: The custom header is not clickable out of the box, but in this case the icon is interactive and allows to show/hide the content area. Responsive Behavior If the width of the panel is set to 100% (default), the panel and its children are resized responsively, depending on its parent container. If the panel has a fixed height, it will take up the space even if the panel is collapsed. When the panel is expandable (the fixed property is set to false), an arrow icon (pointing to the right) appears in front of the header. When the animation is activated, expand/collapse uses a smooth animation to open or close the content area. When the panel expands/collapses, the arrow icon rotates 90 degrees clockwise/counter-clockwise. CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. The ui5-panel exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;header - Used to style the wrapper of the header&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;content - Used to style the wrapper of the content&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Keyboard Handling Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Panel&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleName &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-name&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the accessible aria name of the component. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.15&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleRole &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-role&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;PanelAccessibleRole&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Form&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Sets the accessible aria role of the component. Depending on the usage, you can change the role from the default &lt;code&gt;Form&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Region&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Complementary&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; collapsed &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Indicates whether the component is collapsed and only the header is displayed. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; fixed &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Determines whether the component is in a fixed state that is not expandable/collapsible by user interaction. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; headerLevel &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;header-level&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;TitleLevel&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;H2&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the &quot;aria-level&quot; of component heading, set by the &lt;code&gt;headerText&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Available options are: &lt;code&gt;&quot;H6&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&quot;H1&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; headerText &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;header-text&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; This property is used to set the header text of the component. The text is visible in both expanded and collapsed states. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; This property is overridden by the &lt;code&gt;header&lt;/code&gt; slot. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; noAnimation &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;no-animation&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Indicates whether the transition between the expanded and the collapsed state of the component is animated.

When a ui5-radio-button is selected by the user, the change event is fired. When a ui5-radio-button that is within a group is selected, the one that was previously selected gets automatically deselected. You can group radio buttons by using the name property. Note: If ui5-radio-button is not part of a group, it can be selected once, but can not be deselected back. Keyboard Handling Once the ui5-radio-button is on focus, it might be selected by pressing the Space and Enter keys. The Arrow Down/Arrow Up and Arrow Left/Arrow Right keys can be used to change selection between next/previous radio buttons in one group, while TAB and SHIFT + TAB can be used to enter or leave the radio button group. Note: On entering radio button group, the focus goes to the currently selected radio button.

Radio buttons with the same &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; will form a radio button group. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The selection can be changed with &lt;code&gt;ARROW_UP/DOWN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ARROW_LEFT/RIGHT&lt;/code&gt; keys between radio buttons in same group. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Only one radio button can be selected per group. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; For the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; property to have effect when submitting forms, you must add the following import to your project: &lt;code&gt;import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputElementsFormSupport.js&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; When set, a native &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; HTML element will be created inside the component so that it can be submitted as part of an HTML form. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; readonly &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the component is read-only. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; A read-only component is not editable, but still provides visual feedback upon user interaction. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; text &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the text of the component. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; value &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the form value of the component. When a form with a radio button group is submitted, the group&#39;s value will be the value of the currently selected radio button. &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; For the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; property to have effect, you must add the following import to your project: &lt;code&gt;import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputElementsFormSupport.js&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; valueState &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;value-state&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;ValueState&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;None&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the value state of the component. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Available options are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Error&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Warning&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Success&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Information&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; wrappingType &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;wrapping-type&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;WrappingType&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;None&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the component text wraps when there is not enough space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Available options are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; - The text will be truncated with an ellipsis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; - The text will wrap.

The purpose of the component to enable visual selection of sub-ranges within a given interval. Structure The most important properties of the Range Slider are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;min - The minimum value of the slider range.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;max - The maximum value of the slider range.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;value - The current value of the slider.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;step - Determines the increments in which the slider will move.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;showTooltip - Determines if a tooltip should be displayed above the handle.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;showTickmarks - Displays a visual divider between the step values.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;labelInterval - Labels some or all of the tickmarks with their values.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Notes:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The right and left handle can be moved individually and their positions could therefore switch.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The entire range can be moved along the interval.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt; The most common use case is to select and move sub-ranges on a continuous numerical scale.

Responsive Behavior You can change the size of the Rating Indicator by changing its font-size CSS property. Example: &lt;ui5-rating-indicator style=&quot;font-size: 3rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-rating-indicator&gt; Keyboard Handling When the ui5-rating-indicator is focused, the user can change the rating with the following keyboard shortcuts: [RIGHT/UP] - Increases the value of the rating by one step. If the highest value is reached, does nothing [LEFT/DOWN] - Decreases the value of the rating by one step. If the lowest value is reached, does nothing. [HOME] - Sets the lowest value. [END] - Sets the highest value. [SPACE/ENTER/RETURN] - Increases the value of the rating by one step. If the highest value is reached, sets the rating to the lowest value. Any number - Changes value to the corresponding number. If typed number is larger than the number of values, sets the highest value.

The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; allowTargetOverlap &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;allow-target-overlap&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Determines if there is no enough space, the component can be placed over the target. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; headerText &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;header-text&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the header text. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; If &lt;code&gt;header&lt;/code&gt; slot is provided, the &lt;code&gt;headerText&lt;/code&gt; is ignored. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; hideArrow &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;hide-arrow&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Determines whether the component arrow is hidden. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.15&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; hideBackdrop &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;hide-backdrop&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the block layer will be shown if modal property is set to true. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.10&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; horizontalAlign &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;horizontal-align&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;PopoverHorizontalAlign&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Center&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Determines the horizontal alignment of the component. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Available options are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Center&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Left&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Right&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Stretch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; modal &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the component should close when clicking/tapping outside of the popover.

Stable DOM Refs You can use the following stable DOM refs for the ui5-shellbar: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;logo&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;copilot&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;notifications&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;overflow&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;profile&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;product-switch&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. The ui5-shellbar exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;root - Used to style the outermost wrapper of the ui5-shellbar&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Keyboard Handling Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/ShellBar&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibilityTexts &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;object&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; An object of strings that defines several additional accessibility texts for even further customization.

If no profile slot is set - profile will be excluded from actions. Note: We recommend not using the &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; attribute of &lt;code&gt;ui5-avatar&lt;/code&gt; because it should have specific size by design in the context of &lt;code&gt;ui5-shellbar&lt;/code&gt; profile.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;searchField&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the &lt;code&gt;ui5-input&lt;/code&gt;, that will be used as a search field.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;startButton&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines a &lt;code&gt;ui5-button&lt;/code&gt; in the bar that will be placed in the beginning.

It consists of three containers: header (top-aligned), main navigation section (top-aligned) and the secondary section (bottom-aligned). &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The header is meant for displaying user related information - profile data, avatar, etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The main navigation section is related to the user’s current work context&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The secondary section is mostly used to link additional information that may be of interest (legal information, developer communities, external help, contact information and so on). &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Usage Use the available ui5-side-navigation-item and ui5-side-navigation-sub-item components to build your menu. The items can consist of text only or an icon with text. The use or non-use of icons must be consistent for all items on one level. You must not combine entries with and without icons on the same level. We strongly recommend that you do not use icons on the second level. Keyboard Handling Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/SideNavigation.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/SideNavigationItem.js&quot;; (for ui5-side-navigation-item) import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/SideNavigationSubItem.js&quot;; (for ui5-side-navigation-sub-item) &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

The purpose of the component is to enable visual selection of a value in a continuous numerical range by moving an adjustable handle. Structure The most important properties of the Slider are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;min - The minimum value of the slider range.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;max - The maximum value of the slider range.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;value - The current value of the slider range.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;step - Determines the increments in which the slider will move.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;showTooltip - Determines if a tooltip should be displayed above the handle.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;showTickmarks - Displays a visual divider between the step values.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;labelInterval - Labels some or all of the tickmarks with their values.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Usage The most common use case is to select values on a continuous numerical scale (e.g. temperature, volume, etc. ). Responsive Behavior The ui5-slider component adjusts to the size of its parent container by recalculating and resizing the width of the control. You can move the slider handle in several different ways: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Drag and drop the handle to the desired value.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Click/tap on the range bar to move the handle to that location.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. The ui5-slider exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;progress-container - Used to style the progress container(the horizontal bar which visually represents the range between the minimum and maximum value) of the ui5-slider.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;progress-bar - Used to style the progress bar, which shows the progress of the ui5-slider.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;handle - Used to style the handle of the ui5-slider.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Keyboard Handling Left or Down Arrow - Moves the handle one step to the left, effectively decreasing the component&#39;s value by step amount; Right or Up Arrow - Moves the handle one step to the right, effectively increasing the component&#39;s value by step amount; Left or Down Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd - Moves the handle to the left with step equal to 1/10th of the entire range, effectively decreasing the component&#39;s value by 1/10th of the range; Right or Up Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd - Moves the handle to the right with step equal to 1/10th of the entire range, effectively increasing the component&#39;s value by 1/10th of the range; Plus - Same as Right or Up Arrow; Minus - Same as Left or Down Arrow; Home - Moves the handle to the beginning of the range; End - Moves the handle to the end of the range; Page Up - Same as Right or Up + Ctrl/Cmd; Page Down - Same as Left or Down + Ctrl/Cmd; Escape - Resets the value property after interaction, to the position prior the component&#39;s focusing; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Slider&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

It is constructed of two separate actions - default action and arrow action that can be activated by clicking or tapping, or by pressing certain keyboard keys - Space or Enter for default action, and Arrow Down or Arrow Up for arrow action. Usage ui5-split-button consists two separate buttons: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;for the first one (default action) you can define some text or an icon, or both. Also, it is possible to define different icon for active state of this button - activeIcon.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the second one (arrow action) contains only slim-arrow-down icon.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; You can choose a design from a set of predefined types (the same as for ui5-button) that offer different styling to correspond to the triggered action. Both text and arrow actions have the same design. You can set the ui5-split-button as enabled or disabled. Both parts of an enabled ui5-split-button can be pressed by clicking or tapping it, or by certain keys, which changes the style to provide visual feedback to the user that it is pressed or hovered over with the mouse cursor. A disabled ui5-split-button appears inactive and any of the two buttons cannot be pressed. Keyboard Handling Space or Enter - triggers the default action Shift or Escape - if Space is pressed, releases the default action button without triggering the click event. Arrow Down, Arrow Up, Alt+Arrow Down, Alt+Arrow Up, or F4 - triggers the arrow action There are separate events that are fired on activating of ui5-split-button parts: click for the first button (default action) arrow-click for the second button (arrow action) &lt;/ul&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/SplitButton.js&quot;; Properties/Attributes You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different. Name Type Default Value Description accessibleName accessible-name string Defines the accessible aria name of the component. activeIcon active-icon string &quot;&quot; Defines the icon to be displayed in active state as graphical element within the component. design ButtonDesign &quot;Default&quot; Defines the component design. The available values are: Default Emphasized Positive Negative Transparent Attention disabled boolean false Defines whether the component is disabled. A disabled component can&#39;t be pressed or focused, and it is not in the tab chain. icon string &quot;&quot; Defines the icon to be displayed as graphical element within the component. The SAP-icons font provides numerous options. Example: See all the available icons in the Icon Explorer. Slots This Element provides slot(s). This means it can display its child nodes. Unless targeting the default slot, use the slot attribute to define the destination slot for each child. Text, along with HTML Elements with no slot attribute, goes the the default slot. Slot Type Description default Node [0..n] Defines the text of the component. Note: Although this slot accepts HTML Elements, it is strongly recommended that you only use text in order to preserve the intended design. Events This Web Component fires semantic events upon user interaction. You can bind to these events with the standard DOM APIs, such as addEventListener. Name Description arrow-click Fired when the user clicks on the arrow action. click Fired when the user clicks on the default action. &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Privacy Policy Legal",

The user can change the value of the component by pressing the increase/decrease buttons, by typing a number directly, by using the keyboard up/down and page up/down, or by using the mouse scroll wheel. Decimal values are supported. Usage The default step is 1 but the app developer can set a different one. App developers can set a maximum and minimum value for the StepInput. The increase/decrease button and the up/down keyboard navigation become disabled when the value reaches the max/min or a new value is entered from the input which is greater/less than the max/min. &lt;h4&gt;When to use:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;To adjust amounts, quantities, or other values quickly.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;To adjust values for a specific step.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; When not to use: To enter a static number (for example, postal code, phone number, or ID). In this case, use the regular ui5-input instead. To display a value that rarely needs to be adjusted and does not pertain to a particular step. In this case, use the regular ui5-input instead.

Keyboard Handling The state can be changed by pressing the Space and Enter keys. CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. The ui5-switch exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;slider - Used to style the track, where the handle is being slid&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;text-on - Used to style the textOn property text&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;text-off - Used to style the textOff property text&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;handle - Used to style the handle of the switch&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Switch&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

Navigation through the tabs changes the content display of the currently active content area. A tab can be labeled with text only, or icons with text. Structure The ui5-tabcontainer can hold two types of entities: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;ui5-tab - contains all the information on an item (text and icon)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ui5-tab-separator - used to separate tabs with a line&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Hierarchies Multiple sub tabs could be placed underneath one main tab. Nesting allows deeper hierarchies with indentations to indicate the level of each nested tab. When a tab has both sub tabs and own content its click area is split to allow the user to display the content or alternatively to expand / collapse the list of sub tabs. CSS Shadow Parts CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style elements inside the Shadow DOM. The ui5-tabcontainer exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;content - Used to style the content of the component&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Keyboard Handling Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/TabContainer&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Tab&quot;; (for ui5-tab) import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/TabSeparator&quot;; (for ui5-tab-separator) &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

It provides a comprehensive set of features for displaying and dealing with vast amounts of data. To render the Table properly, the order of the columns should match with the order of the item cells in the rows. Desktop and tablet devices are supported. On tablets, special consideration should be given to the number of visible columns and rows due to the limited performance of some devices. Selection To benefit from the selection mechanism of ui5-table component, you can use the available selection modes: SingleSelect and MultiSelect. In additition to the used mode, you can also specify the ui5-table-row type choosing between Active or Inactive. In SingleSelect mode, you can select both an Active and Inactive row via mouse or by pressing the Space or Enter keys. In MultiSelect mode, you can select both an Active and Inactive row by pressing the Space key when a row is on focus or via mouse click over the selection checkbox of the row. In order to select all the available rows at once, you can use the selection checkbox presented in the table’s header. Note: Currently, when a column is shown as a pop-in, the visual indication for selection is not presented over it. Keyboard Handling Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; Furthermore, you can interact with ui5-table via the following keys. [F7] - If focus is on an interactive control inside an item, moves focus to the corresponding item. [CTRL]+[A] - Selects all items, if MultiSelect mode is enabled. [HOME]/[END] - Focuses the first/last item. [PAGEUP]/[PAGEDOWN] - Moves focus up/down by page size (20 items by default). [ALT]+[DOWN]/[UP] - Switches focus between header, last focused item, and More button (if applies) in either direction. [SHIFT]+[DOWN]/[UP] - Selects the next/previous item in a MultiSelect table, if the current item is selected (Range selection). Otherwise, deselects them (Range deselection). [SHIFT]+[HOME]/[END] - Range selection to the first/last item of the List. [CTRL]+[HOME]/[END] - Same behavior as HOME &amp; END.

The &lt;code&gt;ui5-time-picker&lt;/code&gt; allows users to select a localized time using touch, mouse, or keyboard input. It consists of two parts: the time input field and the sliders. Usage The user can enter a time by: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Using the sliders that are displayed in a popup&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Typing it in directly in the input field&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; When the user makes an entry and chooses the enter key, the sliders shows the corresponding time. When the user directly triggers the sliders display, the actual time is displayed. For the ui5-time-picker Formatting If a time is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used time format. Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. For more information, see UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup Language. For example, if the format-pattern is “HH:mm:ss”, a valid value string is “11:42:35” and the same is displayed in the input.

When not to use: You want to display error or warning message. You want to interrupt users while they are performing an action. You want to make sure that users read the message before they leave the page. You want users to be able to copy some part of the message text.

Users can use the ui5-toggle-button as a switch to turn a setting on or off. It can also be used to represent an independent choice similar to a check box. Clicking or tapping on a ui5-toggle-button changes its state to pressed. The button returns to its initial state when the user clicks or taps on it again. By applying additional custom CSS-styling classes, apps can give a different style to any ui5-toggle-button.

The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; pressed &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Determines whether the component is displayed as pressed. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibilityAttributes &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;object&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; An object of strings that defines several additional accessibility attribute values for customization depending on the use case. It supports the following fields: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;expanded&lt;/code&gt;: Indicates whether the button, or another grouping element it controls, is currently expanded or collapsed. Accepts the following string values: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hasPopup&lt;/code&gt;: Indicates the availability and type of interactive popup element, such as menu or dialog, that can be triggered by the button. Accepts the following string values: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dialog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Grid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ListBox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Menu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;controls&lt;/code&gt;: Identifies the element (or elements) whose contents or presence are controlled by the button element. Accepts a string value.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.2.0&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleName &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-name&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the accessible aria name of the component. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.0.0-rc.15&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; accessibleNameRef &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;accessible-name-ref&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Receives id(or many ids) of the elements that label the component. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.1.0&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; design &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;ButtonDesign&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Default&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the component design. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;The available values are:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Emphasized&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Positive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Negative&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Transparent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Attention&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; disabled &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the component is disabled. A disabled component can&#39;t be pressed or focused, and it is not in the tab chain. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; icon &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the icon, displayed as graphical element within the component. The SAP-icons font provides numerous options. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Example: See all the available icons within the &lt;ui5-link target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/iconExplorer/webapp/index.html&quot; class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-link&quot;&gt;Icon Explorer&lt;/ui5-link&gt;. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; iconEnd &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;icon-end&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines whether the icon should be displayed after the component text. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; submits &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; When set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, the component will automatically submit the nearest HTML form element on &lt;code&gt;press&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; For the &lt;code&gt;submits&lt;/code&gt; property to have effect, you must add the following import to your project: &lt;code&gt;import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputElementsFormSupport.js&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; tooltip &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the tooltip of the component. &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; We recommend setting tooltip to icon-only components. &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-bold api-table-content-cell-since&quot;&gt;since v1.2.0&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title space-top&quot; &gt;Slots&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt; This Element provides slot(s). This means it can display its child nodes.&lt;br&gt; Unless targeting the default slot, use the &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; attribute to define the destination slot for each child.&lt;br&gt; Text, along with HTML Elements with no &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; attribute, goes the the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; slot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Slot&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;default&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;Node [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the text of the component. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Although this slot accepts HTML Elements, it is strongly recommended that you only use text in order to preserve the intended design.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title space-top&quot;&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;This Web Component fires semantic events upon user interaction. You can bind to these events with the standard DOM APIs, such as &lt;code&gt;addEventListener&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;click&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Fired when the component is activated either with a mouse/tap or by using the Enter or Space key. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The event will not be fired if the &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; property is set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;footer class=&quot;footer-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footer-links&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;separator&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sap.com/about/legal/privacy.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sap.com/about/legal/impressum.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Legal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;../../../assets/images/sap-logo-svg.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Sap Logo&quot; /&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;",

Usage When to use: To display hierarchically structured items. To select one or more items out of a set of hierarchically structured items. When not to use: To display items not hierarchically strcutured. In this case, use the List component. To select one item from a very small number of non-hierarchical items. Select or ComboBox might be more appropriate. The hierarchy turns out to have only two levels. In this case, use List with group items. Keyboard Handling The ui5-tree provides advanced keyboard handling. The user can use the following keyboard shortcuts in order to navigate trough the tree: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[UP/DOWN] - Navigates up and down the tree items that are currently visible.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[RIGHT] - Drills down the tree by expanding the tree nodes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[LEFT] - Goes up the tree and collapses the tree nodes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; The user can use the following keyboard shortcuts to perform selection, when the mode property is in use: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;[SPACE] - Selects the currently focused item upon keyup.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[ENTER] - Selects the currently focused item upon keydown.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; ES6 Module Import import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Tree.js&quot;; import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents/dist/TreeItem.js&quot;; &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect.

You can represent an arbitrary tree structure by recursively nesting tree items. Usage ui5-tree-item is an abstract element, representing a node in a ui5-tree. The tree itself is rendered as a list, and each ui5-tree-item is represented by a list item(ui5-li-tree) in that list. Therefore, you should only use ui5-tree-item directly in your apps. The ui5-li-tree list item is internal for the list, and not intended for public use.

It consists of several lists like &lt;code&gt;Sort order&lt;/code&gt; which is built-in and &lt;code&gt;Sort By&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Filter By&lt;/code&gt; lists, for which you must be provide items(&lt;code&gt;ui5-sort-item&lt;/code&gt; &amp; &lt;code&gt;ui5-filter-item&lt;/code&gt; respectively) These options can be used to create sorters for a table. The ui5-view-settings-dialog interrupts the current application processing as it is the only focused UI element and the main screen is dimmed/blocked. The ui5-view-settings-dialog is modal, which means that user action is required before returning to the parent window is possible. Structure A ui5-view-settings-dialog consists of a header, content, and a footer for action buttons. The ui5-view-settings-dialog is usually displayed at the center of the screen. Responsive Behavior ui5-view-settings-dialog stretches on full screen on phones.

It has two main areas - a navigation area at the top showing the step sequence and a content area below it. Structure Navigation area The top most area of the ui5-wizard is occupied by the navigation area. It shows the sequence of steps, where the recommended number of steps is between 3 and 8 steps. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Steps can have different visual representations - numbers or icons. &lt;li&gt; Steps might have labels for better readability - titleText and subTitleText.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Steps are defined by using the ui5-wizard-step as slotted element within the ui5-wizard.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Note: If no selected step is defined, the first step will be auto selected. Note: If multiple selected steps are defined, the last step will be selected. Keyboard Handling The user can navigate using the following keyboard shortcuts: Wizard Progress Navigation [LEFT], [DOWN] - Focus moves backward to the WizardProgressNavAnchors. [UP], [RIGHT] - Focus moves forward to the WizardProgressNavAnchor. [SPACE] or [ENTER], [RETURN] - Selects an active step [HOME] or [PAGE UP] - Focus goes to the first step [END] or [PAGE DOWN] - Focus goes to the last step Fast Navigation This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via F6 / Shift + F6 or Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: import &quot;@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js&quot; Content The content occupies the main part of the page. It can hold any type of HTML elements. It’s defined by using the ui5-wizard-step as slotted element within the ui5-wizard. Scrolling The component handles user scrolling by selecting the closest step, based on the current scroll position and scrolls to particular place, when the user clicks on the step within the navigation area. Important: In order the component’s scrolling behaviour to work, it has to be limited from the outside parent element in terms of height. The component or its parent has to be given percentage or absolute height. Otherwise, the component will be scrolled out with the entire page. For example: &lt;ui5-dialog style=&quot;height: 80%&quot;&gt; &#9;&lt;ui5-wizard&gt;&lt;/ui5-wizard&gt; &lt;/ui5-dialog&gt; Moving to next step The ui5-wizard-step provides the necessary API and it’s up to the user of the component to use it to move to the next step. You have to set its selected property (and remove the disabled one if set) to true. The ui5-wizard will automatically scroll to the content of the newly selected step. The Fiori 3 guidelines recommends having a “nextStep” button in the content area. You can place a button, or any other type of element to trigger step change, inside the ui5-wizard-step, and show/hide it when certain fields are filled or user defined criteria is met. Usage When to use: When the user has to accomplish a long or unfamiliar task. When not to use: When the task has less than 3 steps. Responsive Behavior On small widths the step’s titleText, subtitleText and separators in the navigation area shrink and from particular point the steps are grouped together and overlap. Tapping on them will show a popover to select the step to navigate to. On mobile device, the grouped steps are presented within a dialog.

This means it can display its child nodes.&lt;br&gt; Unless targeting the default slot, use the &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; attribute to define the destination slot for each child.&lt;br&gt; Text, along with HTML Elements with no &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; attribute, goes the the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; slot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Slot&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;default&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;HTMLElement [0..n]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;Defines the steps. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Use the available &lt;code&gt;ui5-wizard-step&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title space-top&quot;&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;This Web Component fires semantic events upon user interaction. You can bind to these events with the standard DOM APIs, such as &lt;code&gt;addEventListener&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;step-change&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Fired when the step is changed by user interaction - either with scrolling, or by clicking on the steps within the component header. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;tr class=&quot;api-table-event-param&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-event-params-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-param-name api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;step&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-event-param-cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;bold&quot; &gt;type:&lt;/strong&gt; HTMLElement &lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;api-table-event-description bold&quot;&gt;description:&lt;/strong&gt; The new step.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr class=&quot;api-table-event-param&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-event-params-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-param-name api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;previousStep&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-event-param-cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;bold&quot; &gt;type:&lt;/strong&gt; HTMLElement &lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;api-table-event-description bold&quot;&gt;description:&lt;/strong&gt; The previous step.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr class=&quot;api-table-event-param&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;api-table-content-event-params-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-param-name api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt;changeWithClick&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-event-param-cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;bold&quot; &gt;type:&lt;/strong&gt; boolean &lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;api-table-event-description bold&quot;&gt;description:&lt;/strong&gt; The step change occurs due to user&#39;s click or &#39;Enter&#39;/&#39;Space&#39; key press on step within the navigation.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;api-container appended-doc&quot;&gt; &lt;h1&gt;WizardStep&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;section class=&quot;component-description&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt; A component that represents a logical step as part of the ui5-wizard. It is meant to aggregate arbitrary HTML elements that form the content of a single step. Structure Each wizard step has arbitrary content. Each wizard step might have texts - defined by the titleText and subtitleText properties. Each wizard step might have an icon - defined by the icon property. Each wizard step might display a number in place of the icon, when it&#39;s missing. Usage The ui5-wizard-step component should be used only as slot of the ui5-wizard component and should not be used standalone. &lt;section class=&quot;component-api space-top&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;comment-api-title&quot; &gt;Properties/Attributes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;small-space-top&quot; &gt;You can use both properties and attributes with the same effect. The name of each attribute is listed below the name of the property, if different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small-space-top api-table&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;head api-table-header-roll&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Default Value&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-header-cell&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; branching &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; When &lt;code&gt;branching&lt;/code&gt; is enabled a dashed line would be displayed after the step, meant to indicate that the next step is not yet known and depends on user choice in the current step. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; It is recommended to use &lt;code&gt;branching&lt;/code&gt; on the last known step and later add new steps when it becomes clear how the wizard flow should continue. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; disabled &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines if the step is &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt;. When disabled the step is displayed, but the user can&#39;t select the step by clicking or navigate to it with scrolling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Step can&#39;t be &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; at the same time. In this case the &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; property would take precedence. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-even&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; icon &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;string&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the &lt;code&gt;icon&lt;/code&gt; of the step. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The icon is displayed in the &lt;code&gt;ui5-wizard&lt;/code&gt; navigation header. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The SAP-icons font provides numerous options. See all the available icons in the &lt;ui5-link target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/iconExplorer/webapp/index.html&quot; class=&quot;api-table-content-cell-link&quot;&gt;Icon Explorer&lt;/ui5-link&gt;. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row api-table-roll-odd&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-bold&quot;&gt; selected &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell&quot;&gt;false&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cell api-table-content-cell api-table-content-cell-description&quot;&gt; Defines the step&#39;s &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; state - the step that is currently active. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Step can&#39;t be &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; at the same time.
